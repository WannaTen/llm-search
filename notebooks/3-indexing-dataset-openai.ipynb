      "The CGT discount applies to individuals who meet the 12-month ownership requirement by disposing of shares after 12 months or more of acquiring them, and those who received new interests in a demerged entity that relate to pre-CGT interests in the head entity and acquired their new interests without a CGT event happening to their original interests. Additionally, individuals may choose to make a capital loss if they hold a share or financial instrument relating to a company that went into liquidation or administration, and a liquidator or administrator of the company made a written declaration that they believed the shares were worthless or the financial instruments had no value or negligible value. Trust non-assessable payments may also be subject to CGT, and if an individual receives a non-assessable payment from a trust, CGT event E4 may occur, which may require cost base adjustments to units or trust interests. However, the eligibility for CGT discount in this context depends on the kind of non-assessable payment received and the adjustments made to the cost base and reduced cost base of the units or interests.\n"

      "Dividends and distributions are terms used interchangeably to refer to payments made to shareholders by a company. If you own shares in a company, you may receive a dividend or distribution. Dividends can be fully franked, meaning that the whole amount of the dividend carries a franking credit, or partially franked, meaning that the dividend has a franked amount and an unfranked amount. The dividend statement or distribution statement you receive from the company paying the franked dividend must state the amount of the franking credit and the amounts of the franked and unfranked parts of the dividend. On the other hand, if a company pays or credits you with an unfranked dividend, there is no franking credit attached to it. The imputation system applies to non-share dividends in the same way that it applies to dividends. A non-share dividend may be franked or unfranked, and any amount of the dividend, whether franked or unfranked, or any amount of franking credit carried by the dividend should be shown at the appropriate item on your tax return as if it were a dividend paid on shares.\n"

The tax authority provides a guide called \"Market Valuation for Tax Purposes\" that explains the principles and processes for establishing a market value for tax purposes, their expectations, and the most common valuations for tax. Certain assets may be exempt from capital gains tax, such as a property transferred under a relationship breakdown rollover or a main residence exemption. However, eligibility and the extent of exemption may depend on various factors such as the period of ownership and use of the property.
