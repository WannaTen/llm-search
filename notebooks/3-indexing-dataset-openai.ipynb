In this case, your acquisition date is\\nthe date on the contract, not when you settle.\\nWhen you inherit a CGT asset.\\n In this case, the acquisition date is the date of\\ndeath of the former owner.\\nYou should establish the date of acquisition because you will need it to work out\\nyour CGT when you dispose of the asset.\\nIt is important because:\\nCGT does not apply if you owned the asset before CGT started on\\n20 September 1985 (but major improvements to a property since\\n20 September 1985 may be subject to CGT)\\nthe rules for working out a capital gain or loss have changed over time\\nto qualify for the CGT discount you need to own the asset for at least\\n12 months.\\nJoint ownership\\nIf you share ownership of an asset with others, each person makes a capital gain or\\nloss.\\nThere are 2 types of shared ownership:\\ntenants in common\\njoint tenants.\\nTenants in common\\nTenants in common are 2 or more people who co-own an asset in defined shares.\\nThe shares may be unequal.\\nWhen a CGT event occurs (such as selling the asset), the individuals split the\\ncapital gain or loss between them according to their share of ownership.\\nExample: tenants in common\\nLui and Monica own a rental property as tenants in common.\\nLui has a 20% share and Monica has an 80% share.\\n9 of 253\\nLui and Monica decide to sell their rental property. They make a capital gain\\nof $200,000.\\nLui and Monica split the capital gain according to their share of ownership:\\nLui has a capital gain of $40,000 (20%)\\nMonica has a capital gain of $160,000 (80%).\\nJoint tenants\\nJoint tenants have equal shares in the asset. Therefore, each person has an equal\\nshare of any capital gain or loss from a CGT event.\\nWhen one joint tenant dies, their share in the asset is \\nacquired in equal shares by\\nthe surviving joint tenants\\n.\\nExample: joint tenants\\nCarmen and Joe own a rental property as joint tenants.\\nThey decide to sell their rental property. They make a capital gain of\\n$68,000.\\nCarmen and Joe each has a capital gain of $34,000 (50%).\\nPartnerships\\nFor CGT purposes, a partnership does not own an asset. Instead, each partner\\nowns a proportion of the asset.\\nWhen a CGT event occurs, the partners use their proportion to work out their\\ncapital gain or loss.\\nKeeping records\\nYou must keep records of all transactions or events that are relevant to working out\\nyour capital gain or loss.\\nWhat to record\\nYour records must be in English or be translatable to English.\\nKeep the following records:\\nreceipts of purchase or transfer\\ndetails of interest on money you borrowed relating to the asset\\n10 of 253\\nrecords of agent, accountant, legal and advertising costs\\nreceipts of insurance costs, rates and land taxes\\nmarket valuations\\nreceipts of maintenance, repair and modification costs\\nbank accounts showing brokerage fees on shares.\\nYou should also keep records to establish whether you have claimed an income tax\\ndeduction for an item of expenditure. If you have claimed a deduction, you cannot\\ninclude the amount in the cost base of the asset.\\nHow long to keep records\\nKeep records for 5 years after the year that the CGT event occurs.\\nExample: keeping records for 5 years\\nLiz sold some shares in September 2021 and made a capital gain.\\nThis means the CGT event happened in the 2021–22 financial year.\\nLiz needs to keep purchase and sale records of the shares until the end of\\nthe 2026–27 financial year (30 June 2027).\\nNet capital loss\\nIf you have a net capital loss for the year, you should keep records of the loss. You\\ncan use the loss to offset a capital gain in a later year.\\nThere is no time limit on how long you can carry forward a net capital loss.\\nOnce you have offset the loss against a capital gain, you should keep records of the\\nCGT event that resulted in the loss.\\nKeep records for a further:\\n2 years for individuals and small and medium businesses\\n4 years for other taxpayers.\\nMissing or destroyed records\\nIf you do not have records for your CGT assets, there are ways you can get the\\ninformation you need. If you:\\nbought a property\\n, ask your solicitor or estate agent to give you copies of the\\nrecords\\nmade improvements to an investment property\\n, ask the builder for a copy of\\nthe receipt for payment\\nbought shares in a company or units in a managed fund\\n, ask your stockbroker\\nor investment adviser to give you the relevant information\\n11 of 253\\nreceived an asset as a gift\\n, ask a professional valuer to tell you what the\\nmarket value would have been\\nlost your records in a natural disaster\\n, we can \\nhelp you reconstruct them\\n.\\nCGT events\\nhttps://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Capital-gains-tax/CGT-events/\\nLast modified: 21 Jun 2022\\nQC 66016\\nHow and when CGT is triggered, such as when an asset is sold, lost or destroyed.\\nOn this page\\nWhat is a CGT event?\\nSale or disposal of asset\\nLoss, theft or destruction of asset\\nAll CGT events\\nWhat is a CGT event?\\nWhen you sell an asset that is subject to capital gains tax (CGT), it is called a CGT\\nevent.

when your asset is lost, destroyed or\\ncompulsorily acquired.\\nOn this page\\nChoosing to roll over your CGT liability\\nEvents eligible for the rollover\\nWorking out the timing of the CGT event\\nApplying the rollover\\nChoosing to roll over your CGT liability\\nIf your capital gains tax (CGT) asset is involuntarily disposed of (lost, destroyed or\\ncompulsorily acquired) and you receive compensation for it, you can roll over your\\nCGT liability.\\nIf you choose to roll over your CGT liability, you defer your liability to pay tax on any\\ncapital gain from the involuntary disposal of the asset.\\nYou do not need make a choice in writing – it will be clear from the way you prepare\\nyour tax return.\\nIf the involuntary disposal results in a capital loss, you can use it to reduce any\\ncapital gain made in the same or later income year.\\nThere are no CGT obligations for assets acquired before 20 September 1985. If you\\nacquired the original asset before this date, any replacement asset is generally\\nexempt from CGT\\n.\\nEvents eligible for the rollover\\nThe rollover is available if any of the following events occur:\\nall or part of your CGT asset is lost or destroyed\\nyour CGT asset is compulsorily acquired by an Australian government agency\\n22 of 253\\n(Australian, state or territory) or by a non-government entity under a power\\ngiven by an Australian or foreign law\\nyou dispose of your CGT asset to an entity (other than a foreign government\\nagency) after a notice is served on you inviting you to negotiate a sale\\nagreement. You must have been informed that if the negotiations are\\nunsuccessful the asset will be compulsorily acquired\\nyou dispose of land to an entity (other than a foreign government agency)\\nwhere  \\na mining lease was, or would have been, compulsorily granted over the\\nland\\nthe lease significantly affected, or would have affected, your use of the\\nland\\nthe entity to which you disposed of the land was, or would have been, the\\nlessee\\na lease that had been granted to you by an Australian government agency\\nunder a Commonwealth, state or territory law expires and is not renewed.\\nThe rollover is not available for the compulsory acquisition of minority interests in\\nCGT assets. For example, the acquisition of shares in a company, under the\\nCorporations Act 2001\\n or similar foreign law, is excluded.\\nMain residence\\nA \\ncompulsory acquisition\\n of part of your main residence may not qualify for the\\nrollover. This is because you may not meet the requirement that you acquire a\\nreplacement asset that is used for the same or a similar purpose.\\nHowever, the \\nmain residence exemption\\n may apply.\\nDepreciating assets\\nA rollover is not available for \\ndepreciating assets\\n, which are exempt from CGT when\\nused solely for taxable purposes. Depreciating assets include business equipment\\nand fittings in a rental property.\\nThe capital allowances provisions may allow for a balancing adjustment offset if the\\ndepreciating asset is:\\nlost or destroyed\\ncompulsorily acquired\\ncompulsorily acquired by forced negotiation (other than by a foreign\\ngovernment agency).\\nWith the capital allowances provision, you can offset the balancing adjustment\\namount against the cost of the replacement asset.\\nVehicles\\nFor rollover relief to apply, the replacement asset cannot be a car, motorcycle or\\nsimilar vehicle.\\nCompensation\\n23 of 253\\nEligibility when money is received\\nYou can choose the rollover only if:\\nyou incur expenditure in acquiring another CGT asset that is used  \\nin your business (or installed ready for use in the business for a\\nreasonable period), if the original asset was a business asset\\nfor a reasonable period for the same or a similar purpose as the original\\nasset\\npart of the original asset is lost or destroyed, and you incur expenditure of a\\ncapital nature in repairing or restoring it.\\nYou must incur at least some of the expenditure:\\nno earlier than one year before the CGT event occurs\\nwithin one year of the end of the income year in which the CGT event occurs.\\nThis period may be extended in special circumstances.\\nThe replacement asset does not need to be identical to the one it is replacing for\\nthe rollover to apply. However, you must use the asset in the same business or for\\nthe same or similar purpose as the original asset.\\nExample: rollover applies\\nTrish owns a bakery. On 1 September 2021 part of her bakery was\\ndestroyed in an electrical fire.\\nTrish paid for repairing the bakery early in the following year and later\\nreceived an insurance payout in compensation for her loss. Her expenditure\\nwould qualify for the rollover if it was incurred any time from 1 September\\n2019 to 30 June 2022.\\n \\nExample: rollover does not apply\\nDenise is compensated when her manufacturing business premises are\\ndestroyed. With this money, she buys a rental property.\\nDenise cannot access the rollover because she does not use the rental\\nproperty for the same or similar purpose as her old business premises.\\nEligibility when a replacement asset is received\\nYou can choose a rollover only if the:\\n24 of 253\\nreplacement asset is not a depreciating asset or held as trading stock when\\nyou acquire it\\nmarket value of the replacement asset is more than the cost base of the\\noriginal asset just before the event occurred.\\nEligibility when both money and a replacement asset are received\\nYou can choose to apply a rollover. However, the requirements and consequences\\nare different for each part of the compensation.\\nWorking out the timing of the CGT event\\nYou need to know when the CGT event occurred to work out in which income year\\na capital gain or loss affects your income tax.\\nIf an asset is lost or destroyed and you receive compensation, the time of the\\nCGT event is when you first received the compensation, such as when you\\nreceived an insurance pay out.\\nIf you do not receive any compensation, the time of the CGT event is when the\\nloss was discovered or the destruction occurred.\\nIf your asset was compulsorily acquired by an entity under an Australian or\\nforeign law, the time of the CGT event is the earlier of when  \\nyou first received compensation from the entity\\nthe entity occupied the asset (for example, land) or took possession of it.\\nIf an entity acquires your asset following negotiation (rather than compulsorily\\nacquiring it), the time of the CGT event is either  \\nthe date of the contract to acquire it\\nthe date of the change of ownership if there was no contract.\\nIf a lease that had been granted to you by an Australian government agency\\n(Australian, state or territory) expires and is not renewed, the time of the CGT\\nevent is when the lease expired.\\nApplying the rollover\\nYou may receive money or another CGT asset (or both) as compensation for the\\ninvoluntary disposal of your CGT asset. The type of compensation you receive\\naffects how you roll over your CGT liability.\\nReceiving money\\nOriginal asset acquired before 20 September 1985\\nIf you acquired the original asset before 20 September 1985, you are taken to have\\nacquired the repaired or replacement asset before that day if you either:\\nrepair or restore the original asset\\nreplace the original asset at either  \\na cost of no more than 120% of its market value at the time of the event\\nany cost, provided all or part of it was lost or destroyed by a natural\\ndisaster and the replacement asset is substantially the same.\\n25 of 253\\nIf a CGT event later occurs to the repaired or replacement asset, you disregard any\\ncapital gain or capital loss you make.\\nOriginal asset acquired on or after 20 September 1985\\nThe way the rollover applies depends on whether the money you received exceeds\\nthe cost of repairing or replacing the asset.\\nMoney received exceeds the repair or replacement cost\\nIf the money you received exceeds the cost you have incurred to repair or replace\\nthe original asset, you may have a CGT liability.\\nThe capital gain you include on your tax return depends on whether your capital\\ngain from the compensation is more or less than the amount by which the\\ncompensation exceeds the cost of repair or replacement.\\nWhen the capital gain is more than the excess\\nIf the capital gain is more than the excess, you reduce the capital gain you report to\\nthe amount of the excess. Include this amount on your tax return in the year the\\nevent happens. This capital gain may be eligible for the CGT discount.\\nWhen a later CGT event happens, you reduce the amount of expenditure included\\nin the cost base of the asset by the difference between the capital gain before it is\\nreduced and the excess. This enables you to defer part of your CGT liability until a\\nlater CGT event happens.\\nWhen the capital gain is less than or equal to the excess\\nIf the capital gain is less than or equal to the excess (the compensation amount less\\nthe cost of the repair or replacement), you do not reduce the capital gain, and the\\namount of the expenditure on the repair or replacement is included in the cost base.\\nExample: money received is more than the replacement expenditure\\nGerard's business premises were destroyed by fire on 15 January 2022. He\\nreceived $246,000 in compensation from his insurance company.\\nIt cost him $240,000 to reconstruct the premises, and the cost base\\nattributed to the building was $230,000.\\nMoney received\\n$246,000\\nCost base\\n$230,000\\nCapital gain\\n$16,000\\n \\nMoney received\\n$246,000\\n26 of 253\\nReplacement expenditure\\n$240,000\\nExcess\\n$6,000\\nThe compensation money ($246,000) is $6,000 more than the replacement\\nexpenditure ($240,000). The capital gain ($16,000) is $10,000 more than\\nthe excess of $6,000. The capital gain is reduced to the excess amount\\nof $6,000.\\nGerard’s capital gain (before applying the CGT discount of 50%) is $6,000.\\nTherefore, assuming he has not made any other capital losses or capital\\ngains in the 2021–22 income year (and does not have any unapplied net\\ncapital losses from earlier years), Gerard includes $3,000 ($6,000 × 50%)\\nas his net capital gain for the 2021–22 income year.\\nAlso, he reduces the expenditure he incurred on the replacement asset by\\nthe balance of the capital gain ($10,000) to $230,000. This means $10,000\\nof the capital gain is deferred. In effect, this reduces the cost base of the\\nnew asset.\\nMoney received does not exceed the repair or replacement cost\\nYou disregard any capital gain and reduce the replacement expenditure you include\\nin the cost base of the asset under a later CGT event by the amount of the capital\\ngain.\\nExample: money received is less than the replacement expenditure\\nAssume that, in the previous example, Gerard spent $257,000 for repairs,\\nand the cost base for the building was $244,000.\\nGerard made a capital gain of $2,000 because the cost base of the building\\nwas $244,000 at the time of the fire.\\nMoney received\\n$246,000\\nCost base\\n$244,000\\nCapital gain\\n$2,000\\n \\nMoney received\\n$246,000\\nReplacement expenditure\\n$257,000\\nShortfall\\n$11,000\\n27 of 253\\nAs the compensation money does not exceed the replacement expenditure,\\nGerard disregards the capital gain.\\nHowever, the amount of expenditure that Gerard can include in the cost\\nbase of the replacement building is reduced by the amount of the capital\\ngain ($2,000) to $255,000.\\nReceiving a replacement asset\\nIf you receive a replacement asset as compensation and you choose to apply a\\nrollover, you disregard any capital gain you make from the original asset.\\nOriginal asset acquired before 20 September 1985\\nYou can treat the replacement asset as if you acquired it before that date.\\nOriginal asset acquired on or after 20 September 1985\\nThe first element of the cost base or reduced cost base of the replacement asset is\\ntaken to be the cost base or reduced cost base of the original asset at the time of\\nthe event.\\nHowever, you may have to recalculate the first element of the cost base of your\\nreplacement asset if:\\nthe cost base of the original asset included an amount of indexation, and\\nyou wish to apply the CGT discount to a capital gain from the replacement\\nasset.\\nExample: asset received\\nThe state government compulsorily acquired land that Jon had bought after\\n19 September 1985.\\nThe cost base of the land at the time it was compulsorily acquired was\\n$180,000. As compensation, Jon received another piece of land with a\\nmarket value of $200,000.\\nBecause the market value of the replacement land was greater than the cost\\nbase of the original land just before it was compulsorily acquired, Jon\\ndisregards the capital gain made on the disposal of the original land.\\nHe is taken to have paid $180,000 to acquire the replacement land (the cost\\nbase of the original land at the time it was compulsorily acquired). This is the\\ncost base of the replacement land in the event of a future CGT event.\\nChoosing the indexation or discount method\\n28 of 253\\nIf a CGT event occurs to the replacement asset, you may be able to use the\\nindexation method\\n or the \\ndiscount method\\n to calculate your capital gain.\\nYou can use either of these methods if the periods of ownership of the original\\nasset and the replacement asset add up to at least 12 months.\\nTo apply the indexation method, you must also have acquired the asset before\\n11:45am (ACT time) on 21 September 1999.\\nReceiving both money and an asset\\nYou need to separately determine what happens to the replacement asset and the\\nmoney. Consider the proportion of the original asset attributable to each type of\\ncompensation.\\nExample: money and an asset received as compensation\\nThe state government compulsorily acquired land Kris bought in 2002. Its\\ncost base at the time was $150,000, but Kris received compensation worth\\n$160,000.\\nHalf of the total compensation was money ($80,000) and half was\\nreplacement land (market value $80,000).\\nTherefore, the cost base of the original land attributable to each part of the\\ncompensation is $75,000 (50% × $150,000). Kris bought additional\\nreplacement land for $82,000.\\nThe total capital gain is $10,000, which is capital proceeds of cash and\\nproperty totalling $160,000, less the cost base of $150,000.\\nHalf of this capital gain can be attributed to the money and half to the asset\\n(the replacement land).\\nThe money Kris received as compensation is less than the amount he paid\\nto buy the additional land. He can, therefore, disregard the $5,000 of the\\ncapital gain that is attributable to the money compensation. He reduces the\\nexpenditure on the additional land by $5,000, so the first element of its cost\\nbase is only $77,000.\\nAs the market value of the replacement land is more than that part of the\\ncost base of the original land, Kris can choose to take rollover relief and\\ndisregard the capital gain of $5,000 relating to the land.\\nAs a result, the value of the replacement land ($75,000) forms the first\\nelement of its cost base, not its market value ($80,000) when it was\\nacquired.\\n29 of 253\\nApplying for an extension on a capital gain\\nrollover\\nhttps://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Capital-gains-tax/CGT-events/Applying-for-\\nan-extension-on-a-capital-gain-rollover/\\nLast modified: 01 Jul 2022\\nQC 66018\\nFind out when and how you can choose to roll over a capital gain, and how to get\\nan extension of time.\\nOn this page\\nWhen and how you make a choice\\nApplying for an extension of time\\nWhen and how you make a choice\\nThe capital gains tax (CGT) rules allow you to roll over capital gains in some\\nsituations.

Property sales usually work this way.\\nIf the asset is lost or destroyed\\n, the CGT event happens when:    \\nyou first receive an insurance payment or other compensation\\nif there is no insurance payment or compensation, when the loss occurred\\nor was discovered.\\nYou can count an asset’s previous ownership towards your 12-month ownership\\nperiod if you acquired it:\\nthrough a \\ndeceased estate\\n if the asset was acquired by the deceased on or\\nafter 20 September 1985\\nthrough a \\nrelationship breakdown\\n – you will satisfy the 12-month requirement if\\nthe combined period your spouse and you owned the asset was more than\\n12 months\\nas a rollover replacement for an asset that was lost, destroyed or compulsorily\\nacquired if the period of ownership of the original asset and the replacement\\nasset was at least 12 months.\\nExclusions from the CGT discount\\nYou cannot use the CGT discount in the following circumstances.\\nHome first used for rental or business in last 12 months\\nIf the asset is your home and you first started \\nusing it for rental or business\\n less\\nthan 12 months before disposing of it, you can't use the CGT discount.\\nYou use the indexation method instead\\nIf you have owned the asset since before 21 September 1999, you can \\nindex the\\ncost of the asset for inflation\\n instead of using the CGT discount. But in most cases\\nyou will get a better result (a smaller capital gain) by using the discount.\\nForeign or temporary residents\\nThe full CGT discount cannot be used for capital gains made by \\nforeign or\\ntemporary residents\\n after 8 May 2012.\\nCreation of new asset\\nThe CGT discount is not available for a CGT event that creates a new asset and a\\ncapital gain. This might happen, for example, with a restrictive covenant, where you\\nreceive payment for agreeing not to do something or granting a lease.\\nIn these cases the asset has not been acquired at least 12 months before the CGT\\nevent.\\nDisposal of interest in a non-widely held entity\\nThe CGT discount may be denied when you dispose of certain shares or trust\\n32 of 253\\ninterests in non-widely held companies and trusts. These are companies and trusts\\nwith fewer than 300 members.\\nConversion of income asset\\nIf an income asset is converted into a capital asset for the purposes of claiming the\\nCGT discount, the discount may be denied (under Part IVA of the \\nIncome Tax\\nAssessment Act 1936\\n).\\nTrusts and companies\\nIf an asset is owned for at least 12 months:\\nAustralian trusts can discount a capital gain by 50%\\ncomplying super funds can discount a capital gain by 33.33%.\\nCompanies cannot use the CGT discount.\\nHow to use the CGT discount\\nCalculating your CGT\\n explains how to use the CGT discount to reduce your tax.\\nBriefly, this is how it works:\\n1\\n. \\nIf you have any capital losses from other assets, you must subtract these from\\nyour capital gains before applying the discount.\\n2\\n. \\nIf you are entitled to the discount for an asset, you reduce the remaining capital\\ngain on that asset by 50% and report this amount in your income tax return.\\nComplying super funds reduce their capital gain by 33.33%.\\nExtra discount for affordable rental housing\\nThere is an additional CGT discount of up to 10% for individuals who are Australian\\nresidents for tax purposes who provide \\naffordable rental housing\\n to people earning\\nlow to moderate income.\\nThis increases the CGT discount to up to 60% for owners of these residential rental\\nproperties.\\nCalculating your CGT\\nhttps://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Capital-gains-tax/Calculating-your-CGT/\\nLast modified: 01 Jul 2022\\nQC 66020\\nUse the calculator or steps to work out your CGT, including your capital proceeds\\nand cost base.\\n33 of 253\\nOn this page\\nWhat you pay tax on\\nHow to calculate your CGT\\nWhat you pay tax on\\nIf you sold assets during the year, such as property or shares, you need to work out\\nyour capital gain or loss for each asset.\\nWhen you sell an asset for:\\nmore than it cost you – you have a capital gain\\nless than it cost you – you have a capital loss.\\nYou pay tax on your \\nnet\\n capital gains.

You can\\nalso access the tool and save your data through your \\nmyGov account\\n.\\nCGT calculator and record keeping tool\\nCalculate CGT yourself\\nStep 1: Work out what you received for the asset\\n34 of 253\\nThis is your \\ncapital proceeds\\n. It is what you receive when you sell the asset or\\nanother CGT event happens to it – for example, if the asset is destroyed and\\nyou receive an insurance payout.\\nIf you give an asset away or sell it to a friend for less than it is worth, your\\ncapital proceeds are the market value of the asset.\\nStep 2: Work out your costs for the asset\\nThis is your \\ncost base\\n. It is what it cost you to acquire the asset, plus certain\\nother costs you had to acquire, hold and dispose of the asset.\\nIf you made a loss on the asset, you work out the loss amount using the\\nreduced cost base\\n.\\nIf you made a gain on the asset and acquired it before 21 September 1999 you\\ncan \\nindex the costs for inflation\\n up to that date instead of using the CGT\\ndiscount to reduce your capital gain. This may give you a lower net capital gain\\nin some circumstances, such as if you also have capital losses.\\nStep 3: Subtract the costs (2) from what you received (1). If the result is:\\nmore than zero, you have a capital gain for this asset\\nless than zero, you have a capital loss for this asset (make sure you used the\\nreduced\\n cost base at step 2).\\nStep 4: Repeat steps 1–3 for each CGT event you have had this financial year\\nfor example, for each asset you have sold.\\nStep 5: Subtract your capital losses from your capital gains\\nIf you have no \\nallowable capital losses\\n, skip to step 7.\\nIf you have a net capital loss carried forward from previous years, subtract this\\nfirst.\\nYou can choose which capital gains to subtract your losses from. If you have\\nany capital gains that are not eligible for the CGT discount, subtract your\\nlosses from these gains first. This will give you the best result (the lowest\\nCGT).\\nStep 6: If the remaining amount is:\\nmore than zero – go to step 7\\nless than zero – this is your net capital loss. Go to step 8.\\nStep 7: Apply the CGT discount (50% for individuals and trusts) to any remaining\\ncapital gains that are eligible\\nGenerally, a capital gain is \\neligible for the discount\\n if you are an Australian\\nresident and you owned the asset for at least 12 months.\\nIf you owned an asset less than 12 months you cannot discount a capital gain\\non that asset.\\nFor complying super funds the discount is 33.33%. Companies cannot use the\\ndiscount.\\nIf you acquired the asset before 21 September 1999 and chose to index its\\ncost base at step 2, you cannot use the discount.\\n35 of 253\\nStep 8: Report your net capital gain or loss in your income tax return\\nIf you have a net capital gain you pay tax on the gain at your marginal income\\ntax rate.\\nIf you have a net capital loss you cannot deduct it from your other income but\\nyou can carry it forward to reduce capital gains you make in future years.\\nExample: working out CGT for a single asset\\nRhi buys an investment property for $500,000 and sells it 5 years later for\\n$600,000.\\nShe has no other capital gains or losses.\\nUsing the \\nsteps above\\n, Rhi works out her capital gain as follows.\\n1\\n. \\nThe capital proceeds from the CGT event are $600,000.\\n2\\n. \\nThe cost base is $530,000, made up of:  \\npurchase costs of $500,000 + $15,000 stamp duty + $1,200\\nconveyancing fees\\nsale costs of $1,300 conveyancing fees + $12,500 agent's\\ncommission.\\n \\n3\\n. \\nRhi’s capital gain on the investment property is:\\n$600,000 − $530,000 = $70,000\\n4\\n. \\nRhi has no other capital gains or losses, so she skips to step 7.\\n5\\n. \\nThis step is not applicable.\\n6\\n. \\nThis step is not applicable.\\n7\\n. \\nRhi can use the CGT discount to reduce her capital gain because she\\nis an Australian resident and owned the asset for at least 12 months:\\n$70,000 × 50% = $35,000\\n8\\n. \\nRhi reports a net capital gain of $35,000 in her income tax return. She\\nwill pay tax on this gain at her marginal income tax rate.\\nThe capital gain for the property happens on the date of the sale contract,\\nnot the date of settlement. For example, if contracts are exchanged on\\n4 June 2022 and settlement happens on 6 July 2022, Rhi must report her\\ncapital gain in her income tax return for the financial year ending 30 June\\n2022.\\n \\nExample: working out CGT for multiple assets\\nTake the same facts as above, except that in addition to the investment\\nproperty, Rhi also sells some shares in the same financial year.\\n36 of 253\\nRhi bought 1,000 shares at $10 each for a total of $10,000, including\\nstamp duty and brokerage costs.\\nRhi sells the shares (at a loss) for $5,500. There are no brokerage\\ncosts on the sale of the shares.\\nUsing the steps above, Rhi works out her net capital gain or loss as follows.\\n1\\n. \\nThe capital proceeds from the sale of the shares are $5,500.\\n2\\n. \\nThe reduced cost base is $10,000. This includes stamp duty and\\nbrokerage, which are costs Rhi had to acquire the asset.\\n3\\n. \\nRhi’s capital loss on the shares is:\\n$5,500 − $10,000 = ($4,500)\\n4\\n. \\nRhi also had a capital gain of $70,000 on her investment property (see\\nprevious example).\\n5\\n. \\n$70,000 (gains) − $4,500 (losses) = $65,500\\n6\\n. \\nRhi has a capital gain so she continues to step 7.\\n7\\n. \\nRhi can use the CGT discount to reduce the remaining capital gain on\\nher investment property:\\n$65,500 × 50% = $32,750\\n8\\n. \\nRhi reports a net capital gain of $32,750 in her income tax return.

If the fourth decimal figure is\\n5 or higher, round it up (for example, 1.4125 would become 1.413).\\nStep 4: Multiply the cost by the indexation factor\\nStep 5: Total your indexed eligible costs and any non-indexed capital costs\\nThis is your indexed cost base for the asset.\\nStep 6: Subtract the indexed cost base from your capital proceeds for the asset\\nThis is your capital gain for the asset.\\nRemember, if you index the cost base you cannot apply the CGT discount.\\nExample – indexing the cost base\\nVal bought an investment property for $150,000 under a contract dated\\n24 June 1991. She paid:\\na deposit of $15,000 on 24 June 1991\\nthe balance of $135,000 on settlement on 5 August 1991\\nstamp duty of $5,000 on 20 July 1991\\nsolicitor's fees of $2,000 on 5 August 1991 as part of settlement.\\nVal sold the property on 15 October 2016 (the day contracts were\\nexchanged) for $600,000. She incurred costs of:\\n$1,500 in solicitor’s fees\\n$15,000 in agent’s commission.\\nUsing the steps above, Val works out her cost base as follows.\\n1\\n. \\nThe costs of buying the property are eligible for indexation.

If Ava never lived in the unit she will not be entitled to the main\\nresidence exemption.\\nArrangements involving the main residence\\nA individual's \\nmain residence\\n (their home) is generally exempt from CGT.\\nThe creation, variation or termination of a granny flat arrangement does not affect\\nthe main residence exemption. This is because the granny flat arrangement is a\\nright to occupy the property, not a right to the property itself.\\nExample: mother transfers home ownership to daughter\\nMary is 70 years old.

However,\\nMary is entitled to the main residence exemption on the transfer of her\\nhome, so there is no CGT liability.\\n89 of 253\\nThe requirements of a granny flat arrangement have been met. Therefore,\\nIsabella will have no CGT liability for granting her mother a right to\\naccommodation for life.\\nAs Isabella moves into the home once she owns it, she will be entitled to the\\nmain residence exemption from CGT if she later sells it.\\nCommercial arrangements\\nIf the granny flat arrangement is commercial in nature, it is not exempt from CGT.\\nThe most obvious commercial arrangement is where the holder of a granny flat\\ninterest is required to make payments (such as rent) at a market rate.\\nHowever, if the individual with a granny flat interest only contributes towards\\nongoing household costs (such as electricity and water), the arrangement is unlikely\\nto be considered commercial. This is because the arrangement is a reimbursement\\nof actual costs.\\nExample: arrangement not commercial in nature\\nYu Yan and Wang Shu have both reached pension age.

However, there\\nare situations where they are treated as separate assets for CGT purposes.\\nThe most common situation is when you acquire a property before CGT started in\\n1985 and make major capital improvements after CGT started.\\nThe improvements are then treated as separate assets that are subject to CGT.\\nThis rule does not affect you if you acquired the property on or after 20 September\\n1985. In this case, CGT applies as usual.\\nMain residence exemption\\nIf the property is your main residence and you use the improvements as part of your\\nhome, they are still exempt.\\nThis includes improvements on land adjacent to the dwelling (for example, a\\nswimming pool) if the total land is 2 hectares or less.\\nThe improvements are not exempt if you use them to produce income.\\nWhat is a major capital improvement?\\nAn addition or improvement, such as renovating a house, is a major capital\\nimprovement if its original cost is both:\\nmore than 5% of the amount you receive when you dispose of the asset\\nmore than the improvement threshold for the income year in which you dispose\\nof the asset.\\nIf you began the improvements before 21 September 1999, you index the original\\ncost for inflation.\\nIf there was a contract to construct the improvements, the date you began the\\nimprovements is the date of the contract.\\n114 of 253\\nImprovement thresholds\\nThe improvement threshold takes inflation into account.\\nIncome year\\nThreshold\\n1985–86\\n$50,000\\n1986–87\\n$53,950\\n1987–88\\n$58,859\\n1988–89\\n$63,450\\n1989–90\\n$68,018\\n1990–91\\n$73,459\\n1991–92\\n$78,160\\n1992–93\\n$80,036\\n1993–94\\n$80,756\\n1994–95\\n$82,290\\n1995–96\\n$84,347\\n1996–97\\n$88,227\\n1997–98\\n$89,992\\n1998–99\\n$89,992\\n1999–2000\\n$91,072\\n2000–01\\n$92,802\\n2001–02\\n$97,721\\n2002–03\\n$101,239\\n2003–04\\n$104,377\\n2004–05\\n$106,882\\n2005–06\\n$109,447\\n2006–07\\n$112,512\\n115 of 253\\n2007–08\\n$116,337\\n2008–09\\n$119,594\\n2009–10\\n$124,258\\n2010–11\\n$126,619\\n2011–12\\n$130,418\\n2012–13\\n$134,200\\n2013–14\\n$136,884\\n2014–15\\n$140,443\\n2015–16\\n$143,392\\n2016–17\\n$145,401\\n2017–18\\n$147,582\\n2018–19\\n$150,386\\n2019–20\\n$153,093\\n2020–21\\n$155,849\\n2021–22\\n$156,784\\n2022–23\\n$162,899\\nCalculating your capital gain or loss on major\\nimprovements\\nYou only need to do this calculation if all of the following are true:\\nyou acquired property before 20 September 1985\\nyou made capital improvements to it on or after that date\\nthe improvements are not exempt under the main residence exemption.\\nWhen you sell the property, you calculate your capital gain or loss on a major\\ncapital improvement as follows.\\nStep 1:\\n Determine the \\ncost base\\n of the improvement.\\nIf you began the improvement before 21 September 1999, you \\nindex the cost\\nbase for inflation\\n116 of 253\\nStep 2:\\n Is the cost base of the improvement (step 1) more than 5% of the capital\\nproceeds from the sale of the property?\\nNo – it is not a major capital improvement and there is no CGT.\\nYes – go to step 3.\\nStep 3:\\n Is the cost base of the improvement (step 1) more than the \\nthreshold\\namount\\n for the year in which you sold the property?\\nNo – it is not a major capital improvement and there is no CGT.\\nYes – go to step 4.\\nStep 4:\\n Work out how much of the sale proceeds are attributable to the\\nimprovement.\\nYou could ask a \\nprofessional valuer\\n to work this out.

He used these renovations to earn rental income\\nfrom the time they were finished until he sold his home.\\nOn 1 December 2021, he sold his home for $500,000.\\nThe 'home first used to produce income' rule does not apply because the\\nrenovations were first used to produce income before 21 August 1996.\\nUsing the \\nsteps above\\n, Martin works out his capital gain as follows:\\n1\\n. \\nThe unindexed cost base of the improvements is $150,000.  \\nBecause the improvements were made before 21 September\\n1999, Martin also needs to work out the indexed cost base. This is\\n$168,450.\\n \\n2\\n. \\nThe indexed cost base is more than 5% of the $500,000 Martin\\nreceived for his home (5% × $500,000 = $25,000).\\n3\\n. \\nThe indexed cost base is more than the 2021–22 threshold of\\n$156,784.

Assuming Martin has no capital losses, he can apply the discount\\nto the entire capital gain.\\nSale proceeds attributable to the improvements\\n$200,000\\nless cost base of improvements (without indexation)\\n$150,000\\nCapital gain\\n$50,000\\nless 50% discount\\n$25,000\\nNet capital gain\\n$25,000\\nMartin would choose the discount method because this gives him a smaller\\ncapital gain.\\nIf construction of the renovations had started after 13 May 1997, Martin\\nwould also reduce the cost base by the amount of any capital works\\ndeductions he could claim.\\nIf Martin made a capital loss, the reduced cost base of the improvements\\nwould be reduced by the amount of any capital works deductions no matter\\nwhen construction started.\\nOther situations where assets are separate for CGT\\nAs well as the major capital improvements discussed above, there are other\\nsituations where land and other assets are treated as separate assets for CGT\\npurposes.\\nRelocation of buildings\\n118 of 253\\nA building is treated as part of new land if you:\\nacquired the building and land before CGT started on 20 September 1985\\nlater relocate the building to new land you acquired on or after this date.\\nThe building becomes part of a single post-CGT asset.\\nThe cost base and reduced cost base of the building are added to the cost base\\nand reduced cost base of the new land.\\nAdjacent land\\nIf you acquire land on or after 20 September 1985 that is adjacent to land you\\nalready owned before that date, it is treated as a separate CGT asset from the\\noriginal land.\\nThis is the case even if you amalgamate the 2 titles.\\nExample: adjacent land treated as separate CGT asset\\nOn 1 April 1984, Dani bought a block of land.\\nOn 1 June 2022, she bought an adjacent block.\\nDani amalgamated the titles of the 2 blocks into one title.\\nThe second block is treated as a separate CGT asset acquired on or after\\n20 September 1985.

true:\\nyou acquired the land on or after 20 September 1985\\na ‘balancing adjustment provision’ applies to the asset.\\nFor example, a timber mill building is subject to a balancing adjustment if it

A person who invests in shares as a shareholder (rather\\nthan a share trader) does so with the intention of earning income from dividends\\nand receipts, but is not carrying on business activities.\\nYou need to consider not only your intention to make a profit, but also the facts of\\nyour situation. This includes how your activities have actually been carried out, or a\\nbusiness plan of how your activities will be carried out.\\nA business plan might show, for example:\\nanalysis of the current market and each potential investment\\nresearch to show when or where a profit may arise\\nthe basis of your decision-making on when to hold or sell shares.\\nRepetition, volume and regularity\\nRepetition – that is, the frequency of transactions or the number of similar\\ntransactions – is a key characteristic of business activities.\\nThe higher the volume of your share transactions, the more likely it is that you are\\ncarrying on a business.\\nA business of share trading would also be expected to involve the purchase of\\nshares on a regular basis through a regular or routine method.\\nOrganisation in a business-like way and keeping records\\nA share-trading business could reasonably be expected to involve:\\nstudy of daily and longer-term trends\\nanalysis of companies' prospectuses and annual reports\\nseeking advice from experts.\\nYour qualifications, expertise, training and skills in this area would also be relevant.\\nFailure to keep records of share transactions would make it difficult for you to\\nestablish that a business of share trading was being carried on.\\nAmount of capital invested\\nThe amount of capital you invest in shares is not a crucial factor in determining\\nwhether you are carrying on a business of share trading.\\n126 of 253\\nIt is possible to carry on business activities with a relatively small amount of capital.\\nOn the other hand, you could invest a substantial amount of capital and not be\\nconsidered a share trader.\\nExample 1: share trader\\nMolly has a full-time job. After seeing a television program, she decides to\\nstart share trading on the side. Molly:\\nsets up an office with a computer in one of the rooms in her house\\nhas $100,000 of her own funds available to buy shares and access to a\\n$50,000 borrowing facility through her bank\\nanalyses daily developments in equity markets, using financial\\nnewspapers and stock market reports, charts and trend lines\\nsubscribes to news from online investment analysts.\\nMolly's objective is to identify stocks that will increase in value in the short\\nterm so she can turn them over quickly at a profit.\\nIn the last income year Molly conducted 60 share transactions (35 buying\\nand 25 selling). The average buying transaction was $1,000. The average\\nselling transaction was $1,800. All the transactions were conducted through\\nonline stockbroking facilities. The average time that Molly held shares\\nbefore selling them was twelve weeks. Molly's activities resulted in a loss of\\n$5,000 after expenses.\\nMolly's activities show all the indicators that she is carrying on a business:\\nHer share trading operation has the intention of making a profit, even\\nthough it had a loss.\\nHer activities are regular and repetitive, and are organised in a\\nbusiness-like manner.\\nShe has turned over a high volume of shares and injected a large\\namount of capital into the operation.\\n \\nExample 2: shareholding as an investor\\nGeorge is an accountant.

The first element of your cost base – the acquisition cost\\n– is the market value of the asset on the day the deceased died.\\nIf the deceased made a major improvement to the asset on or after 20 September\\n1985, the improvement is not treated as a separate asset. You are taken to have\\nacquired a single asset.\\nThe cost base of this single asset is the total of:\\nthe cost base of the major improvement on the day the person died\\nthe market value of the pre-CGT asset, excluding the improvement, on the day\\nthe deceased died.\\nAsset acquired by deceased from 20 September 1985\\nIf the deceased acquired the asset on or after 20 September 1985, the first element\\nof your cost base – the acquisition cost – is generally the deceased’s cost base for\\nthe asset on the day they died.\\nHowever, the first element of your cost base is the market value of the asset on the\\nday the deceased died if the asset:\\nis a property that passed to you after 20 August 1996 (but not as a \\njoint\\ntenant\\n), and just before the deceased died it was their main residence and was\\nnot being used to produce income\\npassed to you as the trustee of a special disability trust.\\nExpenses the beneficiary includes in the cost base\\nAs a beneficiary, you can include in your cost base (and reduced cost base) any\\nexpenditure a legal personal representative (LPR) would have included in their cost\\nbase if they had sold the asset instead of distributing it to you.\\nYou include the expenditure on the date the LPR incurred it.\\nExample: transfer of an asset from executor to beneficiary\\nMaria died on 13 October 2021 leaving 2 assets:\\na parcel of 2,000 shares\\na vacant block of land.\\nThe executor of the estate:\\ndisregarded any capital gain or loss on the transfer of the assets\\nsold the shares to pay Maria's outstanding debts\\ntransferred the land to Maria's beneficiary, Antonio, and paid the\\n148 of 253\\nconveyancing fee of $5,000 upon payment of all debts and tax.\\nThe shares were not transferred to a beneficiary. Therefore, the executor\\nmust include any capital gain or loss on this disposal in the tax return for\\nMaria's deceased estate.\\nThe land was transferred to a beneficiary. Any capital gain or loss on this\\ntransfer is disregarded.\\nThe first element of Antonio's cost base is Maria's cost base on the date of\\nher death. Antonio can include the $5,000 the executor spent on the\\nconveyancing in his cost base.\\nLegal costs incurred by a legal personal representative\\nAs the LPR, in some circumstances, legal costs you incur may form part of the cost\\nbase of the estate's assets.\\nFor example, if a LPR incurs costs to confirm the validity of the deceased's will or\\ndefend a claim for control of the estate, these costs form part of the cost base of the\\nestate's assets.\\nExample: legal costs incurred to prove the validity of a will\\nAnnie is the executor (LPR) of a deceased estate.\\nThe deceased had more than one will prepared prior to their death:\\nThe final will left the estate’s assets to Max.\\nPrior wills had left the estate’s assets to family members.\\nThe family members challenged the validity of the deceased’s will in Court.\\nAs a result, Annie incurred legal costs on behalf of the deceased estate to\\ndefend this action.\\nThe Court held that the final will was valid and granted probate.\\nThe legal costs that Annie incurred to confirm the validity of the will and\\nobtain probate were incurred to preserve or defend the rights over the\\nestate’s assets.\\nAnnie can't claim a deduction for these costs in her capacity as LPR as they\\nare capital in nature. She can, however, include these legal costs in the cost\\nbase of the estate’s assets.\\nHowever, not all costs incurred by a LPR having a connection to estate assets will\\nform part of the cost base of the estate's assets.\\n149 of 253\\nExample: legal costs incurred prior to the deceased’s death\\nCassie is the executor (LPR) of a deceased estate.\\nShortly prior to and in anticipation of the deceased’s death, Cassie acted as\\nthe solicitor for the deceased.\\nCassie prepared an agreement for the transfer of interests in an asset to the\\ndeceased.\\nThese actions were undertaken by Cassie prior to the deceased’s death\\nand the commencing of Cassie’s duties as the LPR of the estate.\\nAny charges for Cassie’s solicitor services that are included in her charges\\nas the LPR can't be included in the cost base of the estate’s assets.\\nHowever, such costs could form part of the cost base of the assets of the\\ndeceased at the date of death.\\nIndexing the cost base of an inherited asset\\nIf the deceased died before 21 September 1999, you have the option of \\nindexing the\\ncost base\\n when you dispose of the asset. Alternatively, you can claim the CGT\\ndiscount. Usually the discount will give you a better result.\\nWith indexation, you calculate your capital gain by using the first element of the\\nasset's cost base indexed for inflation up until 21 September 1999. You do not apply\\nthe discount.\\nIf the deceased died on or after 21 September 1999, you cannot use indexation.

Depending on the circumstances, the cost\\nbase may be based on the value of the asset:\\nwhen the deceased acquired it\\nwhen they died.\\nEligibility for CGT discount or indexation\\nAustralian resident individuals, trusts and super funds can use the \\nCGT discount\\n to\\nreduce their capital gain on assets they have owned for 12 months or more.\\nFor the purposes of qualifying for the CGT discount, you can treat an inherited\\nasset as though you have owned it since:\\nthe deceased acquired the asset, if they acquired it on or after 20 September\\n1985\\nthe deceased died, if they acquired the asset before 20 September 1985.\\nIf the deceased died before 21 September 1999, you have the option of indexing the\\ncost base instead of using the discount. This involves calculating your capital gain\\nby using the asset's cost base indexed for inflation up until 21 September 1999. If\\nyou use indexation, you are taken to have acquired the asset when the deceased\\nacquired it.\\nWinding up a deceased estate\\nIn administering and winding up a deceased estate, the legal personal\\nrepresentative (typically the executor) may need to:\\ndispose of some or all of the estate's assets\\nacquire an asset to satisfy a specific legacy and dispose of the asset to a\\nbeneficiary.\\nIn these situations, CGT applies when the legal personal representative disposes of\\nthe asset. Any capital gain or loss made by the legal personal representative is\\n163 of 253\\nsubject to the normal CGT rules.\\nUnapplied capital losses\\nIf the deceased had any unapplied net capital losses when they died, these do not\\ntransfer to you as a beneficiary or legal personal representative.\\nThis means you cannot use any such losses to offset your net capital gains.\\nKeeping records of inherited assets\\nWhen you inherit an asset, it is important to keep records of:\\nwhen the asset was acquired by the deceased\\nthe asset's value or cost\\ncosts related to the asset that are incurred by you and the legal personal\\nrepresentative of the deceased estate.\\nThese records will help you work out your CGT when you later sell an asset.\\nIf the deceased acquired an asset before 20 September 1985, you will need to\\nknow the asset's market value at the date they died.\\nIf the legal personal representative has had the asset valued, ask for a copy of\\nthe valuation report.\\nIf not, \\nget your own valuation\\nIf the deceased acquired an asset on or after 20 September 1985, you will need\\nrecords of the deceased's cost base for the asset.\\nAssets passing to foreign residents\\nWhen an asset passes to a foreign resident, CGT applies to the deceased's estate\\nat the time of their death if:\\nthe asset was acquired by the deceased on or after the start of CGT\\n(20 September 1985)\\nthe deceased was an Australian resident when they died\\nthe asset is not \\ntaxable Australian property\\n in the hands of the foreign resident\\nbeneficiary.\\nThe capital gain or loss on the asset is worked out using:\\nthe market value of the asset at the date of death\\nthe cost base of the asset at that date (for a capital gain) or reduced cost base\\n(for a capital loss).\\nThe capital gain or loss must be reported in the deceased's date of death tax return.\\nAssets passing to charities and super funds\\nIf a CGT asset passes to a tax-advantaged entity, CGT applies to the deceased's\\n164 of 253\\nestate at the time of their death.\\nA tax-advantaged entity is either:\\na tax-exempt entity such as a church or charity\\nthe trustee of a\\ncomplying super fund\\ncomplying approved deposit fund\\npooled super trust.\\nThe capital gain or loss on the asset is worked out using:\\nthe market value of the asset at the date of death\\nthe cost base of the asset at that date (for a capital gain) or reduced cost base\\n(for a capital loss).\\nThe capital gain or loss must be reported in the deceased's date of death tax return.\\nA capital gain or loss from a testamentary gift can be disregarded if:\\nthe gift is made to a deductible gift recipient, and\\nthe gift would have been income tax deductible if it had not been a\\ntestamentary gift.\\nForeign residents and capital gains tax\\nhttps://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Capital-gains-tax/Foreign-residents-and-\\ncapital-gains-tax/\\nLast modified: 28 Feb 2023\\nQC 66058\\nHow CGT

Therefore, the\\n$750,000 threshold test is applied to the purchase price before adjustment for\\ndisbursements.\\nExcluded assets\\nSome assets are not subject to the withholding, including:\\ntaxable Australian real property with a market value of less than $750,000\\nan indirect Australian real property interest providing a company title interest\\nwith a market value of less than $750,000\\ntransactions conducted through an approved stock exchange\\ntransactions conducted using a broker-operated crossing system, such as a\\n‘dark pool’, as described in the ASIC Market Integrity Rules (ASX Market) 2010\\ntransactions subject to another withholding obligation\\nsecurities lending arrangements, as these don't trigger a CGT liability for the\\nvendor and therefore no payment obligation is imposed\\ntransactions where the vendor is in external administration or transactions\\narising from the administration of a bankrupt estate, a composition or scheme\\nof arrangement, a debt agreement, a personal insolvency agreement, or same\\nor similar circumstances under a foreign law.\\nExceptions\\nForeign resident capital gains withholding doesn't apply when the vendor disposes\\nof either:\\nan Australian real property and provides the purchaser with a \\nclearance\\ncertificate\\n from us\\nany other asset where the purchaser is given a \\nvendor declaration\\nVendor\\nThe vendor is the entity that holds the legal title to the asset this withholding applies\\nto.\\nWhere the asset is held on behalf of another entity, the vendor is the legal owner of\\nthe asset, for example, the trustee or custodian who holds the legal title on behalf of\\nbeneficiaries.\\nWhen the vendor is treated as a foreign resident\\nA vendor is treated as a foreign resident if:\\n177 of 253\\nthe vendor doesn't provide the purchaser with either a valid\\nclearance certificate\\n by settlement, if they are disposing of an asset that\\nrequires a clearance certificate to be provided to avoid the withholding\\nbeing imposed\\nvendor declaration\\n stating they are an Australian resident, or that the\\nmembership interest is not an indirect Australian real property interest,\\nwhen asked to do so by the purchaser with respect to a transaction\\ninvolving an asset for which a vendor declaration can be used to avoid\\nthe withholding being imposed\\n \\nthe purchaser applies the 'knowledge condition'.\\nKnowledge condition\\nThe knowledge condition is only relevant to purchases of indirect Australian real\\nproperty interests (other than company title interests) and options and rights to\\nacquire taxable Australian real property or indirect Australian real property interests.\\nThe knowledge condition will be satisfied where the purchaser either:\\nknows or has reasonable grounds to believe the vendor is a foreign resident\\ndoes not reasonably believe the vendor is an Australian resident and either\\nhas a record about the acquisition indicating the vendor has an address\\noutside Australia\\nis authorised to provide a financial benefit (for example, make a payment)\\nto a place outside Australia (whether to the vendor or to anybody else).\\n \\nEvidence for the knowledge condition\\nA purchaser in applying the knowledge condition must rely upon that information\\nthat it is aware of or has access to in making the decision. In some circumstances\\nthis will only be the share registry of the target entity whose interests are being\\nacquired by the purchaser.\\nIt would be expected that the purchaser would rely upon the share registry no\\nearlier than as at the date of the offer acceptance. Reliance from this date reduces\\nthe possibility that changes in the vendors circumstances would occur up to the\\ndate of the transaction so as to change the purchaser’s belief about the vendor had\\nthey known of it before taking ownership of the interest in the target.\\nPurchasers who are not comfortable determining whether the knowledge condition\\nis satisfied, may seek a vendor declaration confirming the vendor is not a relevant\\nforeign resident.\\nFailure by the vendor to provide the declaration in these circumstances can be\\ntaken by the purchaser as confirmation that the vendor is a relevant foreign\\nresident.\\nClearance certificates\\n178 of 253\\nA clearance certificate provides certainty to purchasers regarding their withholding\\nobligations. It confirms the withholding tax is not applicable to the transaction.\\nThe purchaser must withhold 12.5% of the purchase price in transactions involving\\ntaxable Australian real property, or an indirect Australian real property interest that\\nprovides company title interests, with a market value of $750,000 or more, unless\\nthe vendor shows the purchaser a clearance certificate from us.\\nWe process applications in order of date of receipt. To avoid possible delays in your\\nsettlement, apply online for a clearance certificate at \\nleast 28 days\\n before you\\nrequire it.\\nIt is the vendor’s responsibility to obtain the clearance certificate and provide it to\\nthe purchaser at or before settlement. To avoid unanticipated delays, and to ensure\\nthe certificate is valid at the time it is given to the purchaser, vendors seeking a\\nclearance certificate should apply through the online form as early as practical in\\nthe sale process.\\nWithout being presented with a valid clearance certificate, the purchaser will be\\nrequired to remit 12.5% of the purchase price to us if no other \\nexclusions\\n apply.\\nHow to apply\\nThe Australian resident entity (or their representative) will need to complete an\\nonline \\nClearance certificate application for Australian residents\\nWhere there are multiple Australian resident vendors disposing of the asset, each\\nvendor should apply for a separate clearance certificate in their name only.\\n \\nAustralian residents not required to lodge tax returns, such as aged pensioners, are\\nstill required to obtain a clearance certificate.\\nIf you are a foreign resident there is no point in you lodging an application.\\nHowever, if you may be entitled to a \\nvariation\\n to the withholding rate, then you can\\nlodge a variation request.\\nIf you can't access the webpage phone us on:\\n13 28 66\\n (Fast Key Code \\n4\\n \\n2\\n) within Australia\\n+61 2 6216 1111\\n outside Australia to obtain details of what you need to\\nprovide.\\nWhere a valid clearance certificate is provided, the purchaser is not required to\\nwithhold an amount from the purchase price for the vendor listed in the clearance\\ncertificate.\\nIf an Australian tax resident vendor has had withholding taken from their sale\\nproceeds, for example because they didn't provide the purchaser with a clearance\\ncertificate, they will be able to claim a credit for that amount when they lodge their\\ntax return. This credit may be refunded if they don't have to pay capital gains tax on\\n179 of 253\\nthe sale of the property (for example, because it was their main residence).\\nOnly an \\nAustralian resident entity\\n* can obtain a clearance certificate. Solicitors, tax\\nagents or other representatives of the vendor can apply on the vendor’s behalf.\\nConveyancers, real estate agents and others charging a fee for services (but who\\nare not legal practitioners or registered tax agents) should obtain a completed paper\\nPDF version of the clearance certificate form from the vendor.

If an\\nasset has multiple vendors, each vendor will need to show the purchaser a\\nclearance certificate to ensure amounts are not withheld.\\nIt's valid for 12 months from the date issued, so the vendor may be able to use it for\\nmultiple disposals of real property that occur within the 12 month period. The\\nvendor doesn't have to reapply to us each time they dispose of a property.\\nIt may be provided to the purchaser at any time during the transaction, but must be\\nprovided to the purchaser by settlement.\\nWhen to obtain a clearance certificate\\nAn entity may apply for a clearance certificate at any time they are considering the\\ndisposal of taxable Australian real property. This can be before the property is listed\\nfor sale.\\nYou should apply for a clearance certificate online \\nat least 28 days\\n before you\\nrequire it.\\nHow long it takes\\nWe issue clearance certificates within 28 days of receiving the application.\\nHigher risk and unusual cases may also require greater manual intervention, which\\ncould take longer.\\nIf you lodge your application close to the settlement date, we cannot guarantee we\\ncan process it by the settlement date as we will not disadvantage those other\\n180 of 253\\napplicants who applied earlier by delaying their application to process yours.\\nWhere we send the certificate\\nClearance certificates will be sent by email if an email address is provided in the\\napplication. Care should be taken to ensure that the email address supplied is\\ncurrent and correct to ensure a quick response. Otherwise clearance certificates will\\nbe mailed to the vendor and the vendor’s contact using the addresses provided in\\nthe application.\\nTo avoid unanticipated delays, vendors seeking a clearance certificate should apply\\nthrough the online system as early as practical in the sale process.\\nValid clearance certificate\\nA clearance certificate is valid for 12 months from the date of issue. It's only valid for\\nthe listed vendor and clearance certificate period on the certificate.\\nAs long as the clearance certificate is provided by the vendor to the purchaser\\nduring the time specified on it, and that this is before settlement occurs, then it does\\nnot matter how long into the future the settlement may be. The purchaser does not\\nhave to withhold.\\nAll parties on the Certificate of Title will require a clearance certificate. For example,\\njoint tenants / tenants in common will need to fill out a form each. It is the vendor’s\\nresponsibility to provide the purchaser with the clearance certificate and ensure it's\\nvalid.\\nWhat name should be on the clearance certificate\\nVendors must ensure the details on their clearance certificate application are\\naccurate, so the clearance certificate issues in the correct name as that shown on\\nthe Certificate of Title of the property.\\nFor the purchaser to rely on the clearance certificate, we require the following three\\nconditions be met:\\nThe name of the vendor on the certificate must match the name on the\\ncertificate of title – see \\nTrusts and superannuation funds\\n for further clarification\\nthe date the certificate is given to the purchaser must be a date that falls within\\nthe time period shown on the clearance certificate\\nthe clearance certificate must be provided to the purchaser before settlement.\\nWe will issue a clearance certificate in the name that is in our system. This may\\nmean the name of the vendor on the clearance certificate doesn't match the name of\\nthe vendor on the certificate of title. In these cases:\\nwe accept the purchaser has fulfilled their obligation if the vendor supplies the\\npurchaser clearance certificate and proof of a name change (for example, a\\nmarriage certificate issued from an Australian state or territory registry)\\nwe accept that purchasers have fulfilled their obligation if they have sighted a\\ncertificate where the First Name and Last Name are consistent with the name\\n181 of 253\\non the title\\nan honorific match is not required\\na correct address on a certificate is not required to fulfil the purchaser's\\nobligations\\nit is not necessary to have the instrument number to a title deed on the\\nclearance certificate – for example 'Trustee under instrument ###'\\nit is not necessary to have the details of the trust on the clearance certificate –\\nfor example 'as Trustee for the XYZ Trust'. See \\nTrusts and superannuation\\nfunds\\n for further clarification\\nit is not necessary to have 'as executor for' or 'as legal representative for' on a\\nclearance certificate to fulfil the purchasers obligations (where purchasing from\\na deceased estate). See \\nDeceased estates\\n for further clarification.\\nNote:\\n We will \\nnot\\n reissue certificates in the above instances.\\nWhen a purchaser receives a clearance certificate from a vendor that is valid, they\\ncan rely on it and not withhold. There is no need for the purchaser to question the\\nresidency of the vendor.\\nIf the clearance certificate doesn't meet the above conditions, the purchaser is\\nrequired to withhold 12.5% of the purchase price.\\nAlthough it's not necessary for the purchaser to check the validity of clearance\\ncertificates with us before deciding to withhold the 12.5% amount from the purchase\\nprice, they could decide to do so.\\nYou can phone us on \\n13 28 66\\n (Fast Key Code \\n4 2\\n) to check if the clearance\\ncertificate is valid. You'll need to provide the following information:\\nthe number from the Our reference field at the top of the certificate\\nthe vendor’s name as it appears on the clearance certificate.\\nThe call centre operative will then inform you whether the clearance certificate is\\nvalid.\\nTrusts and superannuation funds\\nThe \\ninstructions for the capital gains withholding clearance certificate application\\nprovide specific details about how the form should be completed.\\nFor trusts and superannuation funds, it is the entity that has legal title to the asset\\nthat applies for the clearance certificate. In most cases this is the trustee. It is the\\ntrustee – \\nin their own capacity as either a company or an individual\\n – that should\\napply for the clearance certificate.\\nThe trustee needs to use their own tax file number (TFN) and/or Australian\\nbusiness number (ABN) as the identifier (if they have one). It is recommended to\\ninclude the Australian Company Number (ACN) as an attachment if they have one.\\nNote:\\n If a corporate trustee does not have a TFN, include an attachment in the\\napplication which provides the details of the relevant trust.\\n182 of 253\\nThe certificate will be issued in the name as it appears on our system. We accept\\nthe purchaser has fulfilled their obligation if the vendor can show that the entity on\\nthe clearance certificate is the trustee of the trust (for example, copy of the trust\\ndeed).\\nThis may be needed where our system contains 'The trustee for ABC Trust'\\nwhereas the title contains 'XYZ as the trustee for ABC Trust', or it has the trustee\\nname only on the clearance certificate.\\nConsolidated groups and multiple entry groups\\nWithholding and intra-group transactions\\nA member of a consolidated group or multiple entry groups that purchases from\\nanother member of the group an asset to which the withholding applies is still\\nrequired to comply with the withholding obligation.\\nEntity obtaining the clearance certificate\\nWe'll issue a clearance certificate to the head company or provisional head\\ncompany of the group which includes the members of the group as an attachment.\\nWe rely upon the group membership information as recorded on our systems. If\\ngroup membership has changed, it's up to the head company to notify us of these\\nchanges before making a clearance certificate request.\\nAlternatively, subsidiary entities can, in their own right, apply for a clearance\\ncertificate and have one issued in their own name.\\nThe contract is for longer than 12 months\\nThere may be instances where the settlement date is after the expiry date on the\\nvendor’s clearance certificate. For example, where an off-the-plan apartment is\\nacquired and the contract period is greater than 12 months.\\nThe purchaser may rely on the clearance certificate being valid as long as the date\\nit's made available to the purchaser, is within the clearance certificate period stated\\non the certificate.\\nDo the rules apply if the market value of the asset acquired is exactly\\n$750,000?\\nYes, the transaction will only be excluded from the rules if the market value of the\\ntaxable Australian real property or company title interest acquired is less than\\n$750,000.\\nEstimated market value $750,000 or above\\nIf the vendor is uncertain whether the $750,000 threshold will be reached (for\\nexample, because the property is going to auction or a sales contract is yet to be\\nsigned) the vendor may wish to be conservative and apply for a clearance\\ncertificate. If the property is then sold for less than $750,000, the vendor doesn't\\nneed to provide the purchaser with the clearance certificate.\\n183 of 253\\nSelling property with multiple titles\\nWhere each parcel of real property sold is subject to a separate title, each is\\nconsidered a separate CGT asset.\\nExample – separate CGT assets\\nBob owns a small farm which consists of three separately titled blocks, each\\nvalued at $700,000 by an independent valuer, but they are not able to be\\nsold separately under the farm's land planning permit. As a separate asset,\\nall three titles would come within the exclusion of subsection 14-215(1) of\\nthe \\nIncome Tax Assessment Act 1997\\n as each has a market value less than\\n$750,000. This is the case regardless of whether there are one or multiple\\ncontracts involved for the sale of the three titles.\\nAny restrictions imposed by planning permits on the titles do not change the\\nfact that each parcel of real property is on a separate title, hence recognised\\nas a separate asset.\\nWhen we withdraw a clearance certificate once it has been issued\\nWe may withdraw a clearance certificate at any time if we obtain further information\\nindicating that the vendor is a foreign resident.\\nThis is to ensure that the vendor is not able to use the clearance certificate where\\nwe determine they have no entitlement to it.\\nWe would expect that the withdrawal of a clearance certificate, once issued, would\\nonly occur in very rare situations given the checks and processes that have been\\nput in place when issuing them.\\nWhere a purchaser has, in good faith, not withheld from the purchase price on the\\nbasis of being provided with a clearance certificate prior to settlement, the\\npurchaser will have met their obligations under the withholding rules.\\nAny subsequent decision by us to withdraw the clearance certificate from the\\nvendor doesn't alter the fact that the purchaser had correctly complied with the\\nwithholding provisions at the time of settlement.\\nThe purchaser will not be subject to any interest or penalty for failure to withhold in\\nthese circumstances, as at no stage was the purchaser required to withhold, given\\nthe vendor had produced a clearance certificate prior to settlement.\\nWhen the vendor provides a fraudulent clearance certificate\\nIf a purchaser receives a document that appears to be a genuine and valid\\nclearance certificate, and in good faith relies on that document to not withhold, we\\n184 of 253\\nwill not pursue the purchaser for the withholding.\\nIf the document is subsequently found to be fraudulent, we will hold the vendor\\nliable for making a false and misleading statement and may prosecute them.\\nDeceased estates\\nWe have set out in a legislative instrument that no withholding (and hence no\\nclearance certificate) is required in the following circumstances:\\na beneficiary acquires ownership of the relevant asset under the deceased\\nindividual’s will, by operation of an intestacy law etc. For example, the name on\\nthe title deed is Joe Smith who is executor for Mary Smith estate\\na beneficiary acquires ownership of the relevant asset from the legal personal\\nrepresentative (executor/trustee) of the deceased individual in a manner not\\ndescribed above\\nthe property devolves to the legal personal representative (executor/trustee)\\nfollowing the death of the individual\\na surviving joint tenant acquires the deceased joint tenant’s interest in a CGT\\nasset. Where the title deed is under the surviving joint tenant's name only, a\\nclearance certificate is required.\\nThe operation of the Instrument extends to circumstances where assets pass to\\nbeneficiaries of a testamentary trust. For more information, see \\nPAYG Withholding\\nvariation for foreign resident capital gains withholding payments – deceased estates\\nand legal personal representatives\\n.\\nAny other transfer or disposal of the relevant asset by the legal personal\\nrepresentative will create a withholding obligation\\n. For example, the legal personal\\nrepresentative (executor/trustee) may decide to transfer or dispose of the relevant\\nassets to a third party.\\nSituations involving mortgagors and mortgagees\\nThis concerns situations where a mortgagor (borrower) has borrowed funds from a\\nmortgagee (creditor, for example a bank), that mortgagor is unable to repay the loan\\nand the mortgagee requires them to sell the secured asset which is subject to\\nwithholding (referred to as property in this section).\\nThere are three situations where this commonly applies:\\nSituation 1\\n – the mortgagor retains title to the sale as the mortgagee has not\\nrepossessed the title to the property but has ordered its sale.\\nSituation 2\\n – where the mortgagee does take possession of the property and\\nsells in that capacity, but there is no transfer of title from mortgagor to\\nmortgagee.\\nSituation 3\\n – the mortgagee has repossessed and taken title to the property\\nfrom the mortgagor. This is commonly known as a foreclosure. In this situation\\nthere are two transactions where foreign resident capital gains withholding\\nmay apply\\nthe transaction concerning the transfer of title from the mortgagor to the\\n185 of 253\\nmortgagee (generally deemed to be a sale of the property at market\\nvalue)\\nthe transaction concerning the transfer of title from the mortgagee to the\\nultimate purchaser.\\n \\nApplying for the clearance certificate or vendor variation\\nThe entity with the title to the property is required to obtain the clearance certificate\\nso foreign resident capital gains withholding won't apply.\\nIn situation 1, the mortgagor remains the legal owner of the property. Therefore it is\\nthe mortgagor who has to obtain the clearance certificate and ensure it is provided\\nto the ultimate purchaser for foreign resident capital gains withholding not to apply.\\nIn the event the mortgagor doesn't cooperate with the mortgagee, then the\\nmortgagee, as a creditor, can apply for a foreign resident capital gains variation to\\nhave the withholding reduced to the extent that the amount it is owed would not be\\ncovered by the sale proceeds if an amount was withheld.\\nIn situation 2, the mortgagee cannot obtain a clearance certificate as they are not\\nthe legal owner of the property. However, the mortgagee can apply for a foreign\\nresident capital gains variation to have the withholding reduced to the extent that\\nthe amount it is owed would not be covered by the sale proceeds if an amount was\\nwithheld.\\nThere is no specific requirement as to who physically provides the clearance\\ncertificate to the purchaser. Therefore, with both situation 1 and 2, if the mortgagor,\\nas vendor, obtains the clearance certificate, then provides it to the mortgagee, and\\nthe mortgagee provides it to the purchaser the ultimate purchaser can verify that the\\nclearance certificate issued to the vendor is valid so long as it matches the name on\\nthe certificate of title.\\nIn situation 3, for foreign resident capital gains withholding not to apply, clearance\\ncertificates are required to be provided to the purchasers for both transactions, that\\nis:\\nrepossession by the mortgagee from the mortgagor. The mortgagor, as the\\nvendor, is the party that has title of the property and therefore would obtain the\\nclearance certificate. As in situation 1, if the mortgagor doesn't co-operate in\\nthis regard, the mortgagee, as a creditor, can apply for a foreign resident\\ncapital gains variation\\nsale of the property by the mortgagee to the ultimate purchaser. As the\\nmortgagee has title to the property it is mortgagee that would obtain the\\nclearance certificate.\\nFor more information, see \\nPAYG Withholding variation for foreign resident capital\\ngains withholding payments - no residue after a mortgagee exercises a power of\\nsale 2020\\n.\\nWhen the purchaser should withhold\\n186 of 253\\nFor the purpose of this part it is assumed that the entity taken to be the vendor is\\nnot entitled to a clearance certificate and therefore foreign resident capital gains\\nwithholding applies.\\nIn situation 1, the mortgagor remains the legal owner of the property. Therefore, if\\nthe mortgagor doesn't have a clearance certificate, the mortgagee is required to\\nwithhold. If either the mortgagor, as vendor, or the mortgagee, as creditor, have\\napplied and been granted a foreign resident capital gains withholding variation, the\\nreduced rate of withholding specified in the variation notice applies.\\nIn situation 2, the purchaser of the property would need to withhold at the 12.5%\\nrate unless the mortgagee has obtained a foreign resident capital gains variation to\\nhave the withholding reduced to the extent that the amount it is owed would not be\\ncovered by the sale proceeds if an amount was withheld. Where a variation has\\nbeen obtained by the mortgagee, the purchaser withholds at the rate specified in\\nthe variation notice provided by us to the mortgagee.\\nFor situation 3, both transactions have to be considered:\\nrepossession by the mortgagee from the mortgagor – foreign resident capital\\ngains withholding applies to this transaction with the mortgagee (creditor)\\nhaving to withhold the 12.5% foreign resident capital gains withholding unless\\neither the mortgagor, as vendor, or the mortgagee, as creditor, have applied\\nand been granted a foreign resident capital gains withholding variation.\\nsale of the property by the mortgagee to the ultimate purchaser – foreign\\nresident capital gains withholding would apply. Therefore, unless the\\nmortgagee has obtained a foreign resident capital gains withholding variation,\\nthe ultimate purchaser is required to withhold at a rate of 12.5%.\\nExceptions\\nThere may be a situation where the mortgagee’s name is not on the title as\\nregistered proprietor (although the mortgage will be listed as an interest on that\\ntitle). This is because the mortgagee has not repossessed the property. However,\\nthe contract of sale will show the vendor as a mortgagee in possession exercising a\\npower of sale under the mortgage.\\nWith respect to paying the foreign resident capital gain's withholding, the name of\\nthe vendor on the purchaser payment notification form must be the mortgagor\\n(borrower) as the mortgagee (creditor) has never taken title to the asset. This\\nensures that the foreign resident capital gains withholding credit that arises\\ncorrectly goes to the borrower which is also the entity that is required to declare the\\ncapital gain.\\nThe company is insolvent or under external administration\\nIf the entity from which the asset is acquired is a company that satisfies any of the\\nconditions in paragraph 161A(1)(a) of the \\nCorporations Act 2001\\n the transaction is\\nexcluded. The purchaser will not have a withholding obligation. This exclusion\\napplies broadly; it is not limited to transactions involving assets for which there is a\\nreceiver.\\n187 of 253\\nAlthough there is no need to provide a clearance certificate to the purchaser in this\\ninstance, the purchaser may want to see evidence from the company or mortgagee\\nthat the exclusion applies to support their decision not to withhold.\\nOn sale of property with no immediate transfer of title\\nA vendor may dispose of a property subject to the withholding regime before they\\nhave taken ownership of it. This is also known as an 'on-sale'.\\nCompany A signs a contract to sell a property for more than $750,000 to\\ncompany B. At this time company B has not taken ownership of the property from\\ncompany A. The legal ownership of the property remains with company A.\\nCompany B’s name is not recorded against the property at the Land Titles Office.\\nPrior to the settlement with company A, company B enters a contract with\\ncompany C for disposal of the property. As a result of this contract company C\\nagrees to acquire the property and undertake the settlement with company A.\\nThe clearance certificate is required from company A to company C.\\nRelationship breakdown\\nThere is no need for a clearance certificate in these circumstances as long as:\\nthe transfer happens under the Family Law Act 1975 or under a State law,\\nTerritory law or foreign law relating to breakdowns of relationships between\\nspouses\\nthe transferee possesses a copy of the relevant documentation specified in\\nsubsection 126-5(1) of the \\nIncome Tax Assessment Act 1997\\n (ITAA 1997) by\\nthe time of the finalisation of the transfer, showing that the asset was acquired\\nin accordance with subparagraph 3(i).\\nFor more information, see \\nPAYG Withholding variation for foreign resident capital\\ngains withholding payments – marriage or relationship breakdowns\\nIncome tax exempt entities\\nThere is no need for the entity to provide a clearance certificate where the entity\\nprovides the purchaser with evidence that they are an income tax exempt entity.\\nThis should either be:\\na private binding ruling confirming its income tax exemption valid for the year in\\nwhich the transaction is occurring\\ndocumentation showing that the entity is endorsed for income tax exemption as\\na registered charity under item 1.1 of section 50-5 of the \\nITAA 1997\\n.\\nFor more information, see \\nPAYG Withholding variation for foreign resident capital\\ngains withholding payments – income tax exempt entities\\nGovernment authorities and not-for-profit organisations\\nThe withholding applies to all transfers of property unless they are specifically\\nexempted.\\n188 of 253\\nGovernment authorities and not-for-profit organisations are not specifically\\nexempted from the withholding and must obtain a clearance certificate or apply for a\\nvariation otherwise the foreign resident capital gains withholding will apply.\\nVendor declarations\\nFor all other asset types subject to foreign resident capital gains withholding, the\\nvendor may provide the purchaser with a vendor’s declaration to specify withholding\\nisn't required on the acquisition of the asset. There are two types of vendor\\ndeclarations:\\nresidency declaration\\nnot an indirect Australian real property interest declaration.\\nTrusts and superannuation funds\\nThe trustee of a trust or superannuation fund completes the vendor application in\\ntheir own capacity as either a company or an individual if the following apply:\\nthey are the entity that has legal title to the asset\\nthere is no mention of the trust or fund or 'in holding the property on trust'.\\nResidency declaration for transactions that are not real property\\nWhere the purchaser believes the vendor is a foreign resident, they can request the\\nvendor make a declaration confirming their Australian tax residency.\\nPurchasers may believe the vendor is a foreign resident if either:\\nthey know the vendor has an address outside of Australia\\nsale proceeds are to be paid to a place outside of Australia.\\nWhen a vendor makes a declaration stating they are an Australian tax resident, the\\npurchaser will not treat them as a foreign resident.\\nAlternatively, the vendor may voluntarily provide a declaration to the purchaser\\nwithout being asked to supply it.\\nPurchaser can rely on the declaration\\nThe purchaser may rely on a residency declaration supplied by the vendor, where\\nthe purchaser is acquiring assets that are not Australian real property. When a\\npurchaser receives a vendor declaration, they will not withhold any amounts unless\\nthey know the declaration is false.\\nNot an indirect Australian real property interest declaration\\nA vendor may provide the purchaser with a declaration confirming either:\\nthat the membership interests they are disposing of are not indirect Australian\\nreal property interests\\nwhere an option is granted, that the membership interests subject to the option\\n189 of 253\\nare not indirect Australian real property interests.\\nThis is allowed, as the vendor would be in the best position to determine if the\\nmembership interest being disposed of, or subject to an option, is an indirect\\nAustralian real property interest.\\nPurchaser can rely on the declaration\\nA ‘Not an indirect Australian real property interest’ declaration supplied by the\\nvendor may be relied on by the purchaser where the purchaser is acquiring the\\nmembership interests in an Australian entity or an option over the membership\\ninterests specified in the declaration.\\nWhere a valid declaration is provided there will be no obligation on the purchaser of\\nthe membership interest, or grantee of the option transaction, to withhold. A\\ndeclaration may be relied on unless the recipient knows the declaration is false.\\nInterests on the stock market\\nWhere a vendor is disposing of the interest in the Australian entity on an approved\\nstock exchange (such as the ASX or Chi-X), there is no need for the declaration to\\nbe provided. This is because interests disposed of on an approved stock exchange\\nare an ‘excluded asset’ for the purposes of this withholding.\\nThis also applies to transactions that occur on a crossing system – for example,\\ndisposal of shares in dark pools.\\nWhen the vendor doesn't supply a declaration when requested\\nIf the vendor doesn't supply a declaration when requested, the purchaser should\\nwithhold 12.5% from the purchase price at settlement.\\nValid declaration from a vendor\\nA vendor’s declaration is valid for six months from the date it's signed by the vendor.\\nIt's only valid for the listed vendor and specified period on the declaration. The\\nspecified period may start retrospectively but cannot exceed six months from the\\ndate the declaration is signed by the vendor.\\nIt's the vendor’s responsibility to provide the purchaser with a declaration and\\nensure the date that it was provided to the purchaser is within the six-month validity\\nperiod of the declaration.\\nFor the purchaser to rely on the declaration, the:\\nname of the vendor on the declaration must match the name of the owner of\\nthe asset (unless proof of name change is provided)\\ndate the vendor provides the declaration to the purchaser must be a date that\\nfalls within the specified period on the declaration.\\nIf the declaration doesn't meet the above conditions, the purchaser is required to\\nwithhold 12.5% of the purchase price.\\nHow to declare\\n190 of 253\\nThere is no approved form that can be completed by the vendor for a declaration.\\nBut we have a template that can be used for this purpose.\\nNext step\\nDownload \\nForeign resident capital gains withholding – vendor declaration\\n(PDF, 222KB)\\nMultiple vendors\\nA declaration is only valid for the vendor specified in the declaration. If an asset is\\nacquired from multiple vendors, each vendor would need to provide the purchaser\\nwith their own declaration, to ensure the withholding obligation does not apply to\\neach of them.\\nDeclarations and the disposal of real property\\nA vendor can't use a declaration to avoid having the purchaser withhold the 12.5%\\nwithholding in relation to the disposal of real property.\\nFalse vendor declarations\\nA purchaser can rely upon the declaration unless they know it to be false.\\nA purchaser will be treated as knowing a vendor declaration is false where they\\nhave specific knowledge of this fact. A purchaser will have such knowledge when\\nthey are a party to the fraud committed by the vendor, or when they have other\\ninformation that indicates the declaration is implausible. The fact the purchaser may\\nhave reasonable grounds to doubt the accuracy of the declaration does not, of\\nitself, and without further information, mean the purchaser can't rely on it.\\nPenalties\\nA vendor that makes a false or misleading declaration must pay a penalty to the\\nCommissioner. The amount of the penalty varies depending on the severity of the\\noffence.\\nThe penalty is:\\n120 penalty units where the vendor has knowingly made a false or misleading\\ndeclaration\\n80 penalty units where they have recklessly made a false or misleading\\ndeclaration\\n40 penalty units where the declaration is false or misleading as a result of the\\nvendor failing to take reasonable care.\\nVariations\\nVendors can apply for a variation where:\\nthey're not entitled to a clearance certificate\\na vendor’s declaration is not appropriate\\n12.5% withholding is too high compared to the actual Australian tax liability on\\n191 of 253\\nthe sale of the asset.\\nReasons for a variation include:\\nthe vendor will not make a capital gain on the transaction (for example,\\nbecause they will make a capital loss or a CGT roll-over applies)\\nthe vendor will not have an income tax liability (for example, because of\\ncarried-forward capital losses or tax losses)\\na creditor of the vendor has a mortgage or other security interest over the\\nproperty, and the proceeds of sale available at settlement are insufficient to\\ncover both the amount to be withheld and to discharge the debt the property\\nsecures\\na creditor acquires legal title to the property (that is, becomes the purchaser)\\nas a result of an order for foreclosure, and its security would be further\\ndiminished as a result of having to comply with the withholding obligation.\\nForeign residents claiming the main residence exemption as a reason for the\\nvariation\\nA law change on 12 December 2019 means foreign residents can no longer claim\\nthe CGT main residence exemption as the reason for their variation unless, at the\\ntime of the CGT event, they were a foreign resident continuously for six years or\\nless and during that time one of the following occurred:\\neither the foreign resident, their spouse, or their child under 18, had a terminal\\nmedical condition\\ntheir spouse, or their child who was under 18 years of age, dies\\nthe CGT event happened because of a formal agreement following your\\ndivorce or relationship breakdown.\\nIf the foreign resident dies, the change also applies to:\\nlegal representatives, trustees and beneficiaries of deceased estates\\nsurviving joint tenants\\nspecial disability trusts\\nWhen the change applies\\nThe change applies to foreign resident vendors for properties acquired at or after\\n7:30 pm (AEST) 9 May 2017. The CGT main residence exemption no longer applies\\nto disposals from that date unless any of the life events (listed above) occur within\\nsix continuous years of that individual becoming a foreign resident for tax purposes.\\nThe change only applies if the person is not an Australian resident for tax purposes\\nat the time of the disposal, that is, when the person signs the contract to sell the\\nproperty. Their residency status in earlier income years will not be relevant. There\\nwill be no partial CGT main residence exemption available in these circumstances.\\nIf a person has always been a foreign resident for tax purposes, it is unlikely they\\nhave ever resided in the property as their \\nmain residence\\n and are unlikely to meet\\nthe requirements for the CGT \\nmain residence exemption\\n.\\n192 of 253\\nLegislative Instruments\\nWe have issued class variations for:\\ndeceased estates and legal personal representatives\\nincome tax exempt entities\\nmarriage or relationship breakdowns\\nno residue after a mortgagee exercises a power of sale\\nIf any of these class variations apply, the withholding rate is varied to nil and it is not\\nnecessary to apply for a variation.\\nHow to apply\\nTo apply for a variation, the vendor, the vendor’s representative or vendor’s creditor\\nneeds to complete the online \\nVariation application for foreign residents and other\\nparties\\n.\\nAn application for a variation should be completed well in advance of the settlement\\ndate to ensure there is enough time to provide the information required to finalise\\nthe application.\\nConveyancers, real estate agents and others charging a fee for services (but who\\nare not legal practitioners or registered tax agents) should obtain a completed paper\\nPDF version of the form from the vendor. They can then use the details on the\\npaper form to complete the online form, ensuring faster processing, as part of the\\nsettlement process.\\nNext step\\nComplete the \\nForeign resident capital gains withholding rate variation paper\\napplication\\nFor more information, see \\nLCR 2016/5\\n \\nForeign resident capital gains withholding\\nregime: the Commissioner's variation power\\nIn the majority of cases (where we have all the required information), the variation\\nnotice will be issued within 28 days.\\nVariation notices will be sent by email if an email address is provided in the\\napplication. Otherwise, notices will be mailed to the vendor and the applicant using\\nthe addresses provided in the application. The variation notice should be shown to\\nthe purchaser before settlement to ensure the reduced withholding rate applies.\\nCalculating the reduced rate of withholding\\nVendors need to calculate their reduced rate of withholding. This could be a rate\\nbetween nil and 12.49%.\\nThe varied rate we approve will depend on the information provided by the vendor\\nin their application.\\n193 of 253\\nUnit price fluctuations\\nIf the indirect interest in taxable Australian real property is in a wholesale trust that\\nhas unit values that fluctuate daily, then there is a risk that the variation would\\nbecome invalid as the unit selling price exceeds the unit price specified in the\\nconditions of the variation notice we issued.\\nAs a solution to this potential problem, the variation condition we provide on the\\nvariation notice can provide a number of alternative prices, with a differing variation\\nrate applying to each. If you are in this situation you should provide information in\\nrelation to possible price differences and what you believe would be an appropriate\\nvariation rate within that price range – this information can be supplied in the\\nattachment to the variation application.\\nMultiple vendors\\nA variation notice applies to the specified vendor and applicable asset on the notice.\\nIf an asset is acquired from multiple vendors, each vendor will need to supply the\\npurchasers with separate variation notices if a reduced rate of withholding is to\\napply.\\nFor more information, see \\nPAYG Withholding variation for foreign resident capital\\ngains withholding payments – acquisitions from multiple entities\\nValid variation notice\\nA variation notice is valid up to and including the expiry date on the notice for the\\nlisted vendor and applicable asset on the notice.\\nIt is the vendor’s responsibility to provide the purchaser with the variation notice and\\nensure it's valid at the time of settlement.\\nFor the purchaser to rely on the variation notice, the:\\nname of the vendor and applicable asset details on the notice must match\\nthose on the certificate of title or other asset ownership documentation (proof\\nof name change should have been provided to us at the time of applying as all\\nvariations are manually processed)\\nthe settlement date must be on or before the expiry date on the variation\\nnotice.\\nWhen a purchaser receives a valid variation notice from a vendor, they can rely on\\nit and withhold amounts from payments at the reduced rate and pay by completing\\nthe \\nForeign Resident Capital Gains Withholding Purchaser Payment Notification\\nform.\\nIf the variation notice doesn't meet the above conditions, the purchaser is required\\nto withhold 12.5% of the purchase price.\\nA purchaser can check the validity of a variation notice with us by phoning \\n13 28 66\\n(Fast Key Code \\n4\\n \\n2\\n) prior to deciding whether to withhold the 12.5% amount from\\n194 of 253\\nthe purchase price. To confirm the validity, the purchaser must provide the:\\nBET number from the ‘Our reference’ field at the top of the notice\\nvendor’s name, varied rate and applicable asset details as they appear on the\\nnotice.\\nCalculating the withholding\\nPurchase price vs market value\\nWith taxable Australian real property, the market value determines whether this\\nwithholding measure needs to be considered.\\nIn most cases, the market value of a property should be the same as the purchase\\nprice. Where the purchase price has been negotiated between the vendor and the\\npurchaser, acting at arm’s length, we will accept the purchase price as a proxy for\\nmarket value.\\nHowever, there could be circumstances where the market value is different to the\\nstated purchase price (for example, where the vendor and purchaser are related\\nparties and did not deal with each other at arm’s length). In such cases, we won't\\naccept the purchase price as a proxy for market value and the purchaser will need\\nto seek a separate expert evaluation.\\nPurchase price vs first element of the cost base\\nThe legislation provides that the purchaser applies the 12.5% withholding rate to\\nthe first element of the cost base of the asset the vendor is disposing of.\\nThe first element of the cost base is a tax technical term, which is the money paid,\\nor required to be paid, to acquire the asset and the market value of any property\\ngiven, or required to be given, in respect of acquiring the asset.\\nIn most cases, the first element of the cost base should be equivalent to the\\npurchase price. Where the purchase price has been negotiated between the vendor\\nand the purchaser, acting at arm’s length, we will accept the purchase price as a\\nproxy for the first element of the cost base.\\nWhere a sales contract contains assets both subject to this withholding measure\\nand not subject to this withholding measure, the purchaser and vendor can decide\\nto come to an agreement as to what are the respective market values of each asset,\\nin determining whether withholding should be imposed upon that share of the\\npurchase price for each asset. Where the parties to the contract are not dealing at\\narm's length an independent valuer may need to be included in the valuation\\nprocess.\\nMultiple properties in one transaction\\nA vendor may be disposing of multiple properties in one transaction, the combined\\nvalue of which exceeds $750,000. The withholding is based on the market value of\\na property being disposed of not a combination of all the properties being disposed\\n195 of 253\\nof, therefore each property needs to be assessed separately for withholding\\nNo additional payment on top of the agreed purchase price\\nThe obligation for the purchaser to withhold an amount and pay it to us isn't an\\nadditional payment on top of the agreed purchase price.\\nThe withholding amount is taken from the purchase price the purchaser has agreed\\nto pay the vendor.\\nHow withholding applies to deposits or instalments\\nWithholding is not required from deposits paid on signing of the contract.\\nIf payments are to be made in multiple instalments across the contract period,\\nwithholding should only occur when the final payment is made at settlement. The\\nwithholding amount is still calculated using the full purchase price of the asset.\\nWhen the contract doesn’t settle\\nIf for some reason the contract is not completed (settled), there is no obligation on\\nthe purchaser to withhold. This is because the vendor has not received the agreed\\npurchase price for the asset.\\nMultiple purchasers (the ATO online form will help in this calculation)\\nWhere there are multiple purchasers, each purchaser doesn't look at their\\npercentage interest in isolation to the other purchasers in determining whether they\\nshould withhold.\\nEach purchaser must withhold in proportion to their percentage of the total\\npurchase price.\\nWhere the asset being disposed of is taxable Australian real property, the market\\nvalue of all purchasers' interests must be aggregated in examining whether the\\n$750,000 market value threshold has been reached.\\nIf the aggregated purchase price is $750,000 or more, each purchaser must\\nwithhold in proportion to their percentage of the total purchase price.\\nExample – Multiple purchasers\\nYou are purchasing a commercial property jointly with another entity. Your\\nshare of the acquisition is 40%, for which you are paying $400,000. This\\nmeans the total property purchase price would be $1 million. Even though\\nyour purchaser’s interest is below the $750,000 threshold, the property as a\\nwhole exceeds the $750,000 threshold so you will need to withhold.\\nEach purchaser will receive a different payment reference number, and a\\nspecified amount / rate to be paid via the online form. You may provide one\\n196 of 253\\ncheque together with the details on how to apportion this amount.\\nMultiple vendors (the ATO online form will help in this calculation)\\nIf there are multiple vendors disposing of the asset, it's the total market value of the\\nasset that determines whether withholding is required by the purchaser.\\nIf the purchaser hasn't been provided with a clearance certificate, vendor\\ndeclaration or a variation from any of the vendors, the purchaser must withhold\\n12.5% of the purchase price. The amount of withholding will be in proportion to\\neach vendor’s interest in the asset.\\nWhere there are multiple Australian vendors disposing of the asset, each vendor\\nshould provide the purchaser with a separate clearance certificate which is to be in\\ntheir name only.\\nWhere one (but not all) of the vendors provides a clearance certificate or vendor\\ndeclaration to the purchaser, the withholding obligation still applies, as there is still a\\nforeign resident vendor to the transaction. The amount of withholding is still on the\\nentire first element of the cost base of the asset, not just the portion attributable to\\nthe relevant foreign resident vendor’s interest in the asset.\\nWe recognise in this situation, any vendors subject to the withholding would apply\\nfor a variation to ensure the withholding amount better reflected the foreign resident\\nvendor’s tax liability. They would receive a reduction in the withholding rate\\naccordingly.\\nTo reduce the need for vendors to apply for variations in these situations, the\\npurchaser may withhold in accordance with each vendor’s proportional interest in\\nthe purchase price, subject to any clearance certificate, vendor declaration or\\nvendor variation being provided prior to settlement.\\nFor more information, see \\nPAYG Withholding variation for foreign resident capital\\ngains withholding payments – acquisitions from multiple entities\\nThe following examples are from the perspective of a purchaser determining their\\nobligation to withhold. In all instances, it's assumed the purchase price is $750,000\\nor more.\\nExample – Joint owners, but only one vendor is an Australian resident\\nThe purchaser has to withhold as there is a foreign resident. The\\nwithholding is based on the full purchase price of the property. The\\npurchaser would need to see the clearance certificate from the Australian\\nresident vendor. Otherwise, they would have to withhold on their interest\\nwithin the property they are disposing of.\\nIf a clearance certificate is provided before settlement, then the purchaser\\n197 of 253\\ndoesn't have to withhold. The withholding would be on the full purchase\\nprice of the property – but we allow the withholding to be calculated only on\\nthe foreign resident’s interest in the property.\\n \\nExample – Foreign resident vendor provides a variation\\nThe circumstances are identical, but now the foreign resident vendor shows\\na variation notice and the Australian vendor provides a clearance certificate.\\nThere is no withholding on the Australian resident’s interest in the property.\\nThere is withholding on the foreign resident’s interest in the purchase price\\nof the property – but the rate of withholding is the withholding rate as\\nspecified on the variation notice issued by us to the foreign resident vendor,\\nnot 12.5%.\\n \\nExample – Multiple foreign resident vendors\\nAs the property is being sold by foreign residents, the purchaser knows they\\nmust withhold. They have not received a clearance certificate, so must\\nassume all the vendors are foreign residents.\\nWith respect to each foreign resident vendor, the amount of withholding is\\nbased on their specific interest in the property – their share of the purchase\\nprice.\\nThe purchaser must consider if any of these vendors has supplied a\\nvariation notice. If no variation notice is received, the withholding is 12.5% of\\nthe contract purchase price, with each vendor being subject to an amount\\nreflective of their interest in the property being sold.\\nIf variation notices are provided by some or all of the foreign resident\\nvendors, the purchaser must calculate the specific withholding rate\\napplicable to each vendor.\\nFor vendors that don't supply a variation notice, the withholding is 12.5% of\\ntheir share of the contract purchase price, reflective of their interest in the\\nproperty being sold.\\nFor vendors that supply a variation notice, the rate of withholding applicable\\nto their specific interest in the purchase price of the property will be the\\nwithholding rate as specified on the variation notice issued by us to that\\n198 of 253\\nparticular foreign resident vendor. It may be the purchaser has to withhold\\n8% from one vendor, and 3% from another vendor.\\nWhen the purchaser fails to withhold\\nIf the purchaser fails to withhold when they should, a penalty may be imposed by\\nthe Commissioner, equal to the amount that was required to be withheld and paid.\\nGeneral interest charges will also be applied.\\nGoods and services tax\\nFor some transactions, it may be necessary to determine if the purchase price\\nneeds to be adjusted for GST in determining the price on which the withholding is\\napplied.\\nWhere a purchaser isn't registered for GST or the supply of the asset isn't a taxable\\nsupply (for example because the vendor isn't registered for GST or the supply is\\ninput taxed), or the purchaser isn't entitled to any input tax credit, the GST inclusive\\npurchase price payable by the purchaser may be used in determining how much\\nwithholding is required.\\nWhere the purchaser is registered for GST and the transaction is a taxable supply*,\\nand the purchaser is entitled to an input tax credit, the GST inclusive purchase price\\nless the input tax credit may be used by the purchaser in determining how much\\nwithholding is required.\\nThe purchase price can't be used as a proxy for market value if the purchaser has\\npaid a premium, or the parties have not dealt with each other at arm’s length.\\n* The sale of existing residential premises (but not commercial residential premises\\nor new residential premises) is input taxed and therefore not a taxable supply.\\nWhere the asset is shares (for example company title interests), the supply of\\nshares is input taxed and therefore not a taxable supply.\\nAn exception – the margin scheme\\nIf the margin scheme is used, a purchaser cannot claim input tax credits on that\\nacquisition, even if they are registered for GST and intend to use the purchased\\nproperty for a creditable purpose.\\nIn these instances, a GST registered purchaser should calculate the 12.5%\\nwithholding by using the GST inclusive price, the same as non-registered\\npurchasers.\\nLeases\\nAcquisition of a lease\\nThe acquisition of a lease with a market value of $750,000 or more from a foreign\\n199 of 253\\nresident lessor would be subject to the 12.5% withholding.\\nWithhold amount if paying a premium for the lease\\nWithholding is only required if the market value of the lease is $750,000 or more. If\\na lessee has paid a premium for a lease, that premium is part of the first element of\\nthe cost base of the leased asset upon which the 12.5% withholding applies.\\nRent and outgoings\\nRent and outgoings are not included in determining the $750,000 market value and\\ndo not form part of the first element of the cost base, of a lease.\\nOptions\\nThe acquisition of an option to acquire an asset subject to this withholding measure\\nfrom a foreign resident would be subject to the 12.5% withholding unless the vendor\\nprovides the purchaser with a valid \\ndeclaration\\n or another \\nexception\\n or \\nexclusion\\napplies. However, where the market value of the option being acquired is less than\\n$8 no withholding applies and no Purchaser payment notification form is required to\\nbe submitted by the purchaser.\\nWhere the option involved is a put option, the grantee is not required to withhold an\\namount because the grantee of a put option has acquired a right to sell, not an\\noption to acquire, the underlying asset.\\nWhere a purchaser acquires the asset as a result of exercising an option, the\\namount to which the 12.5% withholding applies is the amount paid for the asset and\\nthe market value of any property they gave for the option (or to renew or extend the\\noption), but excluding what the purchaser already paid for the option.\\nWhen an option contract is entered before 1 July 2016 but exercised after\\nthat date\\nWhen the option was granted has no bearing on the foreign resident capital gains\\nwithholding implications. It is the time of exercise of the option that is the relevant\\npoint at which the grantee must consider whether the foreign resident capital gains\\nwithholding provisions apply to the amount they are paying the grantor.\\nWhere the option is exercised on or after 1 July 2016 and the asset being acquired\\nis a CGT asset subject to the withholding rules, then the withholding provisions do\\napply to the first element of the cost base of that relevant asset (we accept this is\\nthe purchase price of the asset where there is an arm’s length transaction). This is\\nthe case even when the option was granted prior to 1 July 2016 or where the option\\ncontract doesn't consider foreign resident capital gains withholding.\\nThe withholding is avoided if the vendor provides the purchaser with a valid\\nclearance certificate\\n or declaration, or another exception or exclusion applies.\\nA purchaser that withheld in accordance with their federal income tax obligations\\nwould be protected by sub-section 16-20(2) of Schedule 1 to the \\nTaxation\\n200 of 253\\nAdministration Act 1953\\n. This provides that a purchaser's liability to pay the\\npurchase price is reduced by the withholding amount paid to the Commissioner.\\nEarnouts\\nHow the rules apply will depend on whether the earnout right is one of the following.\\nLook-through standard earnout rights\\nThe purchaser is required to withhold and pay to the Commissioner 12.5% of the\\nfirst element of the CGT asset’s cost base just after the acquisition. The first\\nelement of the CGT asset’s cost base doesn't include any financial benefit the\\npurchaser provides under a look-through standard earnout right relating to the CGT\\nasset.\\nThe purchaser is also required to withhold and pay to the Commissioner 12.5% of\\nthe \\nmarket value\\n of the financial benefits provided by the purchaser under the\\nearnout right, unless the entity receiving the financial benefit is not a \\nrelevant\\nforeign resident\\n at the time the financial benefit is provided.\\nNon-look-through standard earnout right\\nThe purchaser is required to withhold and pay to the Commissioner 12.5% of the\\nfirst element of the CGT asset’s cost base. The non-look-through earnout right is\\nproperty given by the purchaser in respect of acquiring the CGT asset. Therefore,\\nthe first element of the CGT asset’s cost base includes the market value of the\\nearnout right. The purchaser must ascertain the market value of the earnout right at\\nthe time of acquisition and include that value in calculating the 12.5% withholding.\\nThe purchaser is not required to withhold 12.5% of the market value of any financial\\nbenefits provided by the purchaser under the non-look-through earnout right.\\nLook-through reverse earnout right\\nThe purchaser is required to withhold and pay to the Commissioner 12.5% of the\\nfirst element of the CGT asset’s cost base just after the acquisition. The first\\nelement of the CGT asset’s cost base is not reduced by the amount of any financial\\nbenefit that you receive under a look-through earnout right relating to the CGT\\nasset.\\nNon-look-through reverse earnout right\\nThe purchaser is required to withhold and pay to the Commissioner 12.5% of the\\nfirst element of the CGT asset’s cost base. However, the purchaser has acquired\\nmore than one asset. The non-look-through earnout right is a separate CGT asset\\nacquired by the purchaser and not subject to the withholding. Therefore, the first\\nelement of the cost base of the CGT asset that is subject to withholding is the\\namount of the purchase price that is reasonably attributable to that CGT asset.\\nEarnout rights do not affect the market value of the underlying asset\\nAn earnout arrangement may be entered into at the time of sale of an asset where\\n201 of 253\\nthe vendor and purchaser do not agree on a fixed purchase price. However, the\\nmarket value of an asset is not affected by the existence of an earnout right that is\\ncreated at the time of the asset’s sale.\\nThe purchaser cannot use the upfront payment as a proxy for market value\\nPurchasers will need to ascertain the market value of the asset on a different basis,\\nsuch as seeking an independent expert valuation.\\nShare issues / IPOs\\nThe withholding obligation doesn't apply if the purchaser acquires shares as a\\nresult of being issued or allotted those shares through an Initial Public Offer (IPO)\\nbecause the shares will not be indirect Australian real property interests.\\nAn indirect Australian real property interest is a membership interest (for example, a\\nshare) held by one entity in another entity if certain additional conditions are met.\\nAt the time the share issue transaction is entered into, the shares are not\\nmembership interests that the issuing company holds in \\nanother\\n entity (they are\\nmembership interests in the issuing company itself), and therefore cannot be\\nindirect Australian real property interests.\\nAn option to acquire shares\\nThe acquisition of an option to be issued new shares in a company would not be an\\noption that is subject to the withholding on the basis that any shares that could be\\nacquired via the exercise of the option would not be an indirect Australian real\\nproperty interest. \\nPaying the withholding\\nA purchaser must pay us the withholding equal to 12.5% of the first element of the\\nCGT asset’s cost base (the cost base is generally equal to the purchase price).\\nWhere no money is paid or required to be paid, or the agreed amount is under\\nmarket value, then the 12.5% withholding is on the market value of the CGT asset.\\nNote:\\n The first element of cost base doesn't include any disbursements at\\nsettlement (for example, for council rates, water and sewer charges and strata\\nlevies). Therefore, the withholding amount is 12.5% of the purchase price before\\nadjustment for disbursements.\\nThe purchaser is liable to withhold and pay this amount. If this does not occur when\\nit should, we will hold the purchaser liable.\\nWhen the payment is required\\nTo pay the withholding to us, the purchaser must complete an online \\nForeign\\nresident capital gains withholding Purchaser Payment Notification form\\nWhere there are multiple purchasers one form can be used if there are 10 or fewer\\n202 of 253\\npurchasers, or purchasers can lodge a form individually.\\nOnce a payment notification form is processed, a payment reference number (PRN)\\nwill be issued, along with a PDF icon that can be clicked on to obtain a\\ndownloadable payment slip and barcode to use at Australia Post.\\nOnly one PRN is issued per purchaser payment notification form, even if multiple\\npurchasers are supplied on the form.\\nThe purchaser (or purchasers) must pay the withholding to us on or before the day\\nthey become the owner of the asset, and they require the PRN, payment slip and\\nbarcode to do this. Without these, the purchaser will not be able to make the\\npayment at Australia Post.\\nWe encourage purchasers to submit the payment notification form to us as early as\\npossible, to ensure they have the payment reference number at settlement.\\nIf the purchaser fails to obtain a PRN and pay the withholding when they become\\nthe owner of the asset, general interest charges will be imposed.\\nThere is a short grace period from, and including the day of settlement, for the\\nwithholding to be paid in full. General interest charges will accrue from the date of\\nsettlement if we don't receive the withholding within the grace period.\\nAll parties should view the Purchaser payment notification form before settlement\\nproceeds and should contact us if there are changes to the settlement date on the\\nform.\\nPurchaser payment notification form\\nPurchasers are \\nnot\\n required to notify us of a transaction if:\\nthe purchase price of the real property is less than $750,000\\nall vendors have supplied \\nclearance certificates\\nall vendors have supplied \\nvendor declarations\\nall vendors provide a \\nnotice to vary\\n withholding set at 0%.\\nWhen an amount is required to be withheld, a foreign resident capital gains\\nwithholding purchaser payment notification form must be completed by all the\\npurchasers involved in the sale.

Generally the\\nproperty is acquired, and ownership of the property passes, on the date that the\\nacquisition is published in the relevant government gazette.\\nIn the context of a compulsory acquisition certain practical difficulties arise in\\nconnection with determining whether or not there is an obligation to withhold and\\nworking out the withholding amount to be paid on or before the day the acquisition\\nis published in the gazette.

Where the\\npurchase price has been negotiated between the vendor and the purchaser, acting\\nat arm’s length, we will accept the purchase price as a proxy for market value.\\nWhen purchasers must withhold\\nThe purchaser has an obligation to withhold when:\\nany vendor of the asset is a relevant foreign resident\\nthe asset that the purchaser has acquired is a relevant asset\\nthe acquisition is not an excluded transaction\\nthe vendor does not provide a clearance certificate or make a relevant\\ndeclaration.\\nVendors\\nThe obligation to withhold only arises if the vendor is a relevant foreign resident for\\nthe purposes of this measure.\\nThe vendor is the entity that holds the legal title to the asset to which this\\nwithholding measure applies.\\nWhere the asset is held on behalf of another entity, the vendor is the legal owner of\\nthe asset, for example, the trustee or custodian who holds the legal title on behalf of\\nbeneficiaries.\\n210 of 253\\nUnless an exception applies, the vendor is a relevant foreign resident if any of the\\nfollowing apply:\\nThe purchaser knows the vendor is a foreign resident.\\nThe purchaser reasonably believes the vendor is a foreign resident.\\nThe purchaser does not reasonably believe the vendor is an Australian\\nresident, and either      \\nhas a record about the acquisition indicating that the vendor has an\\naddress outside Australia\\nis authorised by the vendor to provide a related financial benefit (for\\nexample, make a payment) to a place outside Australia (whether to the\\nvendor or to anyone else).\\n \\nThe vendor has a connection outside Australia of a kind specified in the\\nregulations.\\nThe capital gains tax (CGT) asset to which the transaction relates is\\ntaxable Australian real property\\nan indirect Australian real property interest, the holding of which causes a\\ncompany title interest to arise.\\n \\nExceptions\\nA vendor is not a relevant foreign resident if they provide the purchaser with:\\na valid clearance certificate in transactions involving taxable Australian real\\nproperty or indirect Australian real property company title interests (even if the\\nvendor is actually an Australian resident for other income tax purposes)\\na valid vendor declaration in transactions involving other assets covered by the\\nforeign resident capital gains withholding law.\\nTaxable Australian real property or indirect Australian real property\\ncompany title interests\\nWhere the capital gains tax (CGT) asset to which the transaction relates is taxable\\nAustralian real property or an indirect Australian real property company title interest,\\nthe entity is treated as a relevant foreign resident unless a clearance certificate is\\nobtained from us certifying that the entity is not a relevant foreign resident for the\\npurposes of this law.\\nThis rule applies even if the vendor is actually an Australian resident for other\\nincome tax purposes.\\nClearance certificates\\nWe may issue a certificate (known as a clearance certificate) stating that the vendor\\nof taxable Australian real property or an indirect Australian real property company\\ntitle interest is not a relevant foreign resident. The clearance certificate will specify\\nthat withholding is not required on the acquisition of the property.\\n211 of 253\\nA clearance certificate is valid for 12 months from the date issued, so the vendor\\nmay be able to use it for multiple disposals of real property or indirect Australian real\\nproperty company title interests that occur within that period. The vendor does not\\nhave to reapply for a clearance certificate each time they dispose of a property, as\\nlong as the clearance certificate is valid.\\nThe clearance certificate may be provided to the purchaser at any time during the\\ntransaction, but must be provided to the purchaser by settlement.\\nThe purchaser can rely on the clearance certificate as proof that they are not\\nrequired to withhold. Once the purchaser has received a copy of the clearance\\ncertificate they have met their obligation, even if the vendor’s circumstances change\\nduring the settlement period.\\nTo obtain a clearance certificate, a vendor who is an Australian resident (or their\\nrepresentative) must complete an online \\nForeign resident capital gains withholding\\nclearance certificate application\\n form (NAT 74883). To access the form, visit\\nato.gov.au/FRCGW\\n.\\nConveyancers who are not legal practitioners or registered tax agents cannot\\ncomplete the form on behalf of the vendor. They can either provide the PDF version\\nof the clearance certificate form (or URL hyperlink) to the vendor for them to\\ncomplete. Conveyancers may either submit the completed PDF form to us via mail\\nor enter the data into the online form (retaining a copy of the vendor-signed PDF\\nform and keeping a printout of data entered into the online form).\\nExample: Resident entity treated as a foreign resident vendor\\nLouis purchases real estate in Melbourne from Lucas for $3 million. This is\\ntaxable Australian real property. Louis believes that Lucas is an Australian\\nresident.\\nDespite Louis’s belief, unless Lucas provides Louis with a clearance\\ncertificate from us, Lucas is treated as a relevant foreign resident.\\nLouis must make a withholding payment to us.\\n \\nExample: Clearance certificate process\\nJennifer is acquiring an apartment in Sydney for $2.6 million from a vendor\\nwhose legal representatives are based in Singapore. The vendor’s\\nAustralian conveyancer has provided a clearance certificate obtained from\\nus (for the vendor) to Jennifer.\\n212 of 253\\nThe contract instructions advise that the funds should be transferred to a\\nbank account overseas.\\nJennifer and her representatives are certain they are acquiring the\\napartment from a foreign resident. Irrespective of this, the vendor has\\nprovided a valid clearance certificate to Jennifer. Jennifer is able to rely on\\nthis clearance certificate and does not have to withhold and pay any foreign\\nresident capital gains withholding from the payment of $2.6 million.\\nHow long it will take to get a clearance certificate\\nWe issue clearance certificates within 28 days of receiving the application.\\nWhere the application requires further information from the applicant or has factors\\nthat may be considered higher risk or unusual, this will increase the time it takes to\\nprocess. If the application is lodged close to the settlement date, we cannot\\nguarantee we can process it by the settlement date as we will not disadvantage\\nthose other applicants who applied earlier by delaying their application to process\\nyours.\\nClearance certificates will be sent by email if an email address is provided in the\\napplication. Otherwise clearance certificates will be mailed to the vendor and the\\nvendor’s contact using the addresses provided in the application.\\nTo avoid unanticipated delays, vendors seeking a clearance certificate should apply\\nthrough the online system as early as practical in the sale process. This could be\\nbefore offering the property for sale.\\nClearance certificate validity\\nA clearance certificate is valid for 12 months from the date of issue. It is only valid\\nfor the listed vendor and the period noted on it.\\nVendors must ensure that the details on their clearance certificate application are\\naccurate, so the clearance certificate issues in the correct name.\\nIt is the vendor’s responsibility to provide the purchaser with the clearance\\ncertificate and ensure it is valid.\\nFor the purchaser to rely on the clearance certificate, the:\\nname of the vendor on the certificate must match the name on the certificate of\\ntitle (unless proof of name change is provided)\\ndate the certificate is given to the purchaser must be a date that falls within the\\nclearance certificate period and must be provided before settlement.\\nWhen a purchaser receives a clearance certificate from a vendor and sees that it is\\nvalid, they can rely on it and not withhold. There is no need for the purchaser to\\nquestion the residency of the vendor.\\n213 of 253\\nHowever, if the clearance certificate does not meet these conditions, the purchaser\\nis required to withhold 12.5% of the purchase price.\\nAlthough not a requirement, purchasers may check the validity of clearance\\ncertificates with us prior to deciding whether to withhold the 12.5% amount from the\\npurchase price. Phone us on \\n13 28 66\\n (fast key codes \\n4\\n \\n2\\n) to confirm the validity of\\nthe clearance certificate by providing:\\nthe number from the ‘Our reference’ field at the top of the certificate\\nthe vendor’s name as it appears on the clearance certificate.\\nWhere there are multiple vendors\\nA clearance certificate only applies to the entity specified on the certificate. If an\\nasset has multiple vendors, each vendor will need to supply the purchaser with a\\nclearance certificate to ensure amounts are not withheld.\\nThe rules apply if the market value of the asset acquired is exactly\\n$750,000\\nThe transaction will only be excluded from the rules if the market value of the\\ntaxable Australian real property or company title interest acquired is \\nless\\n than\\n$750,000.\\nIf the market value is unknown\\nIf the vendor is uncertain whether the $750,000 threshold will be reached, for\\nexample because the property is going to auction or a sales contract is yet to be\\nsigned, they can be conservative and apply for a clearance certificate. If the\\nproperty is then sold for less than $750,000, the vendor does not need to provide\\nthe purchaser with the clearance certificate.\\nDisbursements and other costs as part of the market value of the asset\\nWe recognise that disposals of real property may involve the payment of\\ndisbursements as part of the contract.\\nIf the adjustment changes the consideration paid for the asset, then the calculation\\nof the amount to be withheld should be based on the final adjusted purchase price.\\nWhere the purchase price is used as a proxy for market value, the market value is\\nthe purchase price before adjustment for any disbursements at settlement (for\\nexample, for council rates, water and sewer charges and strata levies). Therefore,\\nthe $750,000 threshold test is applied to the purchase price before adjustment for\\ndisbursements.\\nOther assets\\nFor other assets, the purchaser’s decision about whether the vendor is a relevant\\nforeign resident depends on whether the purchaser either:\\nhas received one of two declarations which they do not know to be false, either\\n214 of 253\\na residency declaration\\na declaration that the membership interest is not an indirect Australian\\nreal property interest\\n \\nknows, or has reasonable grounds to believe, the vendor is a foreign resident\\n(referred to as the knowledge condition).\\nA vendor may make a standing declaration which remains valid for six months after\\nthe day the declaration is made.\\nThe purchaser can rely on the declaration unless they know it to be false.\\nResidency declarations\\nThe vendor will not be a relevant foreign resident where they have provided a\\ndeclaration to the purchaser that they are an Australian resident (unless the\\npurchaser knows it to be false).\\nA declaration is only effective in relation to the specific vendor. If an asset is\\nacquired from multiple vendors, a purchaser requires a declaration from each\\nvendor or they must withhold.\\nA declaration as to residency can be relied upon for:\\nindirect Australian real property interests (other than company title interests)\\noptions and rights to acquire taxable Australian real property or indirect\\nAustralian real property interests.\\nA purchaser can rely on a declaration, even if a purchaser has reasonable grounds\\nto doubt its accuracy.\\nHowever, if the purchaser knows the declaration is false, the declaration has no\\neffect on the obligation to withhold. A purchaser will only know a declaration to be\\nfalse if they have specific knowledge of the fact. That is, the purchaser must be a\\nparty to the fraud committed by the vendor or must have knowledge that the\\ndeclaration is completely implausible.\\nIn all other circumstances, the declaration can be relied on.\\nDeclarations that the membership interest is not an\\nindirect Australian real property interest\\nA vendor can make a declaration that the CGT asset is a membership interest, but\\nnot an indirect Australian real property interest, because the membership interest\\ndoes not satisfy either the:\\nnon-portfolio interest test\\nprincipal asset test.\\nMembership interests that are not indirect Australian real property interests are not\\nwithin the scope of the law.\\n215 of 253\\nThe vendor is likely to be in a better position than the purchaser to determine\\nwhether the membership interests satisfy the tests for an indirect Australian real\\nproperty interest.\\nTo support this, the obligation to withhold does not apply where the purchaser relies\\non a declaration by the vendor that the interests are not indirect Australian real\\nproperty interests. A purchaser may rely on the declaration even though the\\ndeclaration may be inaccurate, unless the purchaser has specific knowledge that\\nthe declaration is false.\\nIf the vendor does not supply a declaration when requested\\nIf the vendor does not supply a declaration when requested, the purchaser should\\nwithhold 12.5% from the purchase price at settlement.\\nWhen a declaration from a vendor is valid\\nA vendor’s declaration is valid for six months from the date it is signed by the\\nvendor. It is only valid for the listed vendor and specified period on the declaration.\\nIt is the vendor’s responsibility to provide the purchaser with a declaration and\\nensure it is valid at the time it’s provided.\\nThe purchaser can rely on the declaration if the:\\nname of the vendor on the declaration matches the name of the owner of the\\nasset\\ndate the vendor provides the declaration to the purchaser is a date that falls\\nwithin the specified period on the declaration and is provided before\\nsettlement.\\nWhen a purchaser receives a valid declaration from a vendor they can rely on it and\\nnot withhold.\\nIf the declaration does not meet these conditions, the purchaser must withhold\\n12.5% of the purchase price.\\nThere is no declaration form\\nHowever a template that can be used is available for download from our website at\\nato.gov.au/FRCGW\\n.\\nIf there are multiple vendors\\nA declaration is only valid for the vendor specified in the declaration. If an asset is\\nacquired from multiple vendors, each vendor would need to provide the purchaser\\nwith their own declaration to ensure that the withholding obligation does not apply to\\neach of them.\\nDeclarations and the disposal of real property\\nA vendor cannot use a declaration to avoid having the purchaser withhold the\\n216 of 253\\n12.5% withholding in relation to the disposal of real property.\\nPenalties for false declarations\\nA vendor who makes a declaration that is false or misleading will have a penalty\\nimposed upon them by us. The amount of the penalty varies depending on the\\nseverity of the offence.\\nThe knowledge condition\\nThe purchaser only has to consider the knowledge condition if the vendor has not\\nsupplied a vendor declaration.\\nThe knowledge condition is satisfied where the purchaser:\\nhas specific knowledge that the vendor is a foreign resident – for example, the\\npurchaser will have specific knowledge if the vendor discloses that they are a\\nforeign resident for income tax purposes\\nreasonably believes that the vendor is a foreign resident – for example, the\\npurchaser may have a reasonable belief if they learn the vendor is likely to be\\nliving overseas\\nhas no reasonable grounds to believe the vendor is an Australian resident, and\\nthe amount is to be paid outside Australia, or the vendor has a foreign address.\\nWhere there are reasonable grounds to believe the vendor is an Australian resident,\\nwithholding will not be required, even if an amount is paid outside Australia, or the\\nvendor has an address outside Australia.\\nReasonable grounds to believe the vendor is (or is not) an Australian resident must\\nbe considered on an objective basis. The question is whether a reasonable person\\nin the position of the purchaser would have thought there were reasonable grounds\\nto support this belief.\\nIf the purchaser does not know or have reason to believe the vendor is a foreign\\nresident, the knowledge condition ensures that the obligation to pay an amount to\\nus does not arise. This provides certainty to purchasers.\\nPurchasers who are not comfortable applying the knowledge condition can ask the\\nvendor to supply a vendor declaration. If the vendor does not supply a valid vendor\\ndeclaration then the purchaser can assume the vendor is a relevant foreign resident\\nand that they must withhold.\\nExample: Declaration used to determine residency\\nAndrew enters into an off-market transaction to acquire all the shares in a\\ncompany. The majority of the company’s investments are in real property\\nholdings throughout Australia. The shares, therefore, constitute indirect\\nAustralian real property interests.\\nAndrew does not know the vendor of the shares. Under the terms of the sale\\n217 of 253\\ncontract, Andrew is to transfer the purchase price of the shares to an\\noverseas bank account in the name of an associate of the vendor.\\nAt this stage, the knowledge condition is satisfied. Andrew notifies the\\nvendor that he intends to withhold a portion of the purchase price unless the\\nvendor can provide Andrew with a declaration.\\nThe vendor provides Andrew with a declaration stating the vendor is an\\nAustralian resident for income tax purposes, which Andrew does not know to\\nbe false. The knowledge condition is no longer relevant because Andrew\\nhas a declaration that the vendor is an Australian resident, that he is entitled\\nto rely on.\\nEven if Andrew could not verify the declaration to the extent necessary for\\nhim to have a reasonable belief in its accuracy, he could rely on it and no\\nwithholding and payment obligation would arise.\\n \\nExample: Vendor declaration that they are a resident\\nZack and Belinda enter into an off-market transaction to acquire all of the\\nshares in a company from a friend of their family. The majority of the\\ncompany’s investments are in real property holdings throughout Australia.\\nThe shares, therefore, constitute indirect Australian real property interests.\\nThe friend has not provided a declaration to Zack or Belinda stating that the\\nshares are not an indirect Australian real property interest, or that the friend\\nis an Australian resident.\\nIn deciding if they need to withhold from the payment, Zack and Belinda\\nconsider their relationship with the vendor. They have known the family\\nfriend for many years, and have no reason to think the family friend has an\\naddress outside Australia. They also take into account the fact that the\\nfunds were to be paid into an Australian bank account.\\nConsequently, Zack and Belinda are satisfied they have met the knowledge\\ncondition, as they reasonably believe the family friend to be a resident.\\nHence, they do not withhold.\\nAssets\\nThe law applies to the following assets:\\ntaxable Australian real property\\nan indirect Australian real property interest\\n218 of 253\\nan option or right to acquire such property or such an interest.\\nThe law only applies to these assets. Transactions involving other assets that are\\ntaxable Australian property are not subject to withholding, for example, an asset\\nused in running a business through an Australian permanent establishment is\\nexcluded.\\nExample: Relevant assets\\nForeign resident Hank owns a range of assets in Australia which he has\\ndecided to dispose of to fund an investment in the USA. The assets are:\\na residential block of apartments in Melbourne\\na portfolio of shares in an ASX200 listed index fund\\nthe inventory from a manufacturing business in Sydney\\na mining tenement allowing exploration within North Queensland\\na lease on agricultural land in the Murray River Basin\\nan option to acquire shares in a carpet cleaning business.\\nThe residential block of apartments is a relevant asset. It is taxable\\nAustralian real property, being land or buildings situated within Australia.\\nThe portfolio of shares in an ASX listed fund is not a relevant asset. The law\\nexcludes transactions made on an approved stock exchange.\\nThe inventory is not a relevant asset. Inventory is not taxable Australian real\\nproperty and not an indirect Australian real property interest.\\nThe mining tenement is a relevant asset. It is taxable Australian real\\nproperty, the definition of which includes ‘a mining, quarrying or prospecting\\nright’.\\nThe lease on agricultural land is a relevant asset. A lease of land is\\nspecifically included within the definition of taxable Australian real property.\\nThe option is not a relevant asset. The asset that the option relates to is not\\ntaxable Australian real property or an indirect Australian real property\\ninterest.\\nTaxable Australian real property\\nA CGT asset will be taxable Australian real property if it is:\\nreal property situated in Australia (including a lease of land, if the land is in\\nAustralia)\\na mining, quarrying or prospecting right (to the extent that the right is not real\\nproperty) if the minerals, petroleum or quarrying materials are in Australia.\\nFor the purposes of this measure, real property includes vacant land, buildings,\\n219 of 253\\nresidential and commercial property, and indirect Australian real property interests,\\nthe holding of which causes a company title interest to arise.\\nIndirect Australian real property interest\\nFor a membership interest in an entity to be an indirect Australian real property\\ninterest at a particular time, the membership interest must satisfy two tests, being\\nboth:\\nthe non-portfolio interest test\\nthe principal asset test.\\nMembership interest includes shares in a company.\\nThe non-portfolio interest test\\nAn interest held by an entity (the holding entity) in another entity (the test entity) is a\\nnon-portfolio interest if the sum of the membership interests held by the holding\\nentity (and their associates) in the test entity is 10% or more.\\nThe test is satisfied if the membership interest is a non-portfolio interest at the time\\nof the transaction, or through a 12-month period in the last 24 months leading up to\\nthe transaction.\\nThe principal asset test\\nThe principal asset test is used to determine if an entity’s underlying value is\\nprincipally derived from Australian real property.\\nA membership interest in an entity passes the principal asset test if the sum of the\\nmarket value of the entity’s assets that are taxable Australian real property exceed\\nthe sum of the market value of the assets that are not.\\nExample: Applying the non-portfolio interest and principal asset tests\\nForeign resident Kimiko has held a 15% interest in an Australian mining\\ncompany from an initial purchase offer in 2011. With the downturn in\\ncommodity prices she has sold 8% of that interest.\\nWill this sale be subject to the withholding regime? A valuation of the mining\\ncompany’s assets was undertaken at the time of the sale. It provides that the\\nmarket values of the assets are:\\nmining rights $1.7 million\\nplant and equipment $4.1 million\\nmining information $2.8 million\\nland $5 million.\\nNon-portfolio interest test\\nAt the time Kimiko disposed of her interest in the mining company, she held\\n220 of 253\\na 15% interest. This satisfies the requirement that the interest be 10% or\\nabove.\\nThat she has only disposed of 8% of its interest in the mining company has\\nno bearing on the non-portfolio test. It is the interest held at the time of the\\ndisposal that is the key factor. As long as that is at least 10%, any disposal\\nof that interest can be subject to the withholding.\\nPrincipal asset test\\nThe assets of the mining company that are taxable Australian real property\\nare the land and the mining rights. The mining information and plant and\\nequipment (assumed for this example) do not come within the scope of\\ntaxable Australian real property.\\nThis means the market values of the taxable Australian real property of the\\nmining company is $6.7 million and of the other assets $6.9 million.\\nAs the sum of the market values of the non- taxable Australian real property\\nassets exceeds that of the taxable Australian real property, then the principal\\nasset test is not satisfied.\\nConsequently, the 8% interest that Kimiko has disposed of is not an indirect\\nAustralian real property interest, so no foreign resident capital gains\\nwithholding would apply to the disposal by the foreign resident.\\nOptions and rights to acquire certain assets\\nAn option or right to acquire property is a CGT asset of the holder of the right.\\nWhere an option or a right is granted by a foreign resident over taxable Australian\\nreal property or an indirect Australian real property interest, the granting of the\\noption or right will be subject to withholding.\\nWhere the purchaser subsequently acquires the asset from the foreign resident as\\na result of exercising the option, the amount to which the 12.5% withholding applies\\nis the amount paid for the asset, disregarding any amount the purchaser paid for the\\noption, including the market value of any property they gave for the option (or to\\nrenew or extend the option).\\nExample: Exercise of an option\\nAustralian company Oz Co acquires an option from a foreign resident entity,\\ngiving it the right to purchase a commercial property for $62 million within\\n18 months of taking the option.\\nOz Co then pays $4 million, withholds $500,000 and pays this to us.\\n14 months after the option purchase date, commercial property prices\\n221 of 253\\nincrease to such an extent that Oz Co decides to exercise the option and\\nacquire the property for $62 million.\\nAll the conditions are met for the foreign resident capital gains withholding to\\noccur. The law ensures that Oz Co only withholds from $58 million, being\\nthe $62 million contract price less the $4 million paid for the option. Oz Co\\nwithholds and pays $7.25 million to us.\\nExcluded transactions\\nThe law excludes certain transactions from the obligation to withhold. The vendor\\nwill need to determine their income tax or capital gains tax obligations when\\ncompleting their income tax return.\\nTaxable Australian real property valued at under $750,000\\nThe law excludes transactions involving taxable Australian real property with a\\nmarket value of less than $750,000. The exclusion applies for all taxable Australian\\nreal property, including:\\nresidential premises\\ncommercial property\\nvacant land\\nleasehold\\neasements\\ncovenants\\nmortgages\\nstratum title schemes.\\nIn most cases, the market value of a property will be the purchase price. Where the\\npurchase price has been negotiated between the vendor and the purchaser, acting\\nat arm’s length, we will accept the purchase price as a proxy for market value.\\nExample: The $750,000 threshold\\nForeign resident Juan sells his bayside mansion. The contract is signed on\\n2 July 2017 for a sale price of $690,000. Juan and the purchaser were\\nunknown to each other, and the transaction occurred through their legal and\\nconveyancing representatives.\\nIn many cases a purchase price negotiated between a purchaser and\\nvendor, acting at arm’s length, would be the same as the market value and it\\nwould not be necessary for the purchaser to seek a separate expert\\nvaluation. In these cases the purchase price may be used as a proxy for\\nmarket value.\\nAs a result, no withholding is required in this instance.\\n222 of 253\\n \\nExample: How the $750,000 threshold applies with multiple purchasers\\nFour residents purchase a small apartment complex for $2.8 million from a\\nforeign resident with whom they have no existing relationship. The\\nrespective purchaser interests are 45%, 25%, 18% and 12%.\\nIs withholding to be imposed?\\nIf the withholding obligation is considered for each purchaser in isolation to\\nthe others, it would be shown that purchaser one is paying $1.26 million for\\ntheir share of the apartment complex. Each of the other three purchasers is\\npaying less than $750,000 for their respective interests.\\nThe measure requires the market value of all purchasers to be aggregated\\nin examining whether the $750,000 market value threshold has been\\nreached.\\nAs the aggregated purchase price (market value) from all the purchasers is\\n$2.8 million, each purchaser must withhold an amount in proportion to their\\npercentage of the total purchase price.\\nIn total $350,000 must be withheld and paid to us.\\nCompany title interests valued at under $750,000\\nThe law excludes transactions involving membership interests that cause a\\ncompany title interest to arise where those membership interests have a market\\nvalue of less than $750,000.\\nThis aligns the treatment for entities that own property through company title with\\nthe treatment for those that own property through strata title.\\nOther indirect real property interests do not fall within this exclusion.\\nTransactions on an approved stock exchange\\nThe law excludes transactions made on an approved stock exchange.\\nThe nature of these transactions makes it impossible for a purchaser to determine\\nthe identity and residency status of the vendor.\\nExample: Sales on an approved stock exchange\\n223 of 253\\nForeign resident Xing Xi owns shares in two Australian entities. His interests\\nmeet the requirements to be indirect Australian real property interests. One\\ninterest is listed on Chi-X Australia and the other is listed on the Australian\\nSecurities Exchange (ASX).\\nChi-X Australia and the ASX are approved stock exchanges. Therefore the\\ntransactions are not considered for the purposes of this withholding\\nmeasure.\\nTransactions on a crossing system\\nThe law excludes from withholding any transactions conducted using a crossing\\nsystem.\\nA crossing system (also known as a ‘dark pool’) is a system that enables trading off-\\nmarket, although the trades are typically reported to the market immediately after\\nthey take place.\\nAs with transactions that occur on an approved stock exchange, it may not be\\npossible for a purchaser to determine the identity and residency status of the\\nvendor.\\nSecurities lending arrangements\\nA ‘securities lending arrangement’ is an arrangement where a holder of securities\\nagrees to provide its securities to a borrower for a specified period of time, with an\\nassociated agreement by the borrower to return equivalent securities at the end of\\nthe agreed period. These arrangements are typically entered into for purposes such\\nas short-selling or hedging.\\nThe law excludes such transactions.\\nExternal administration and bankruptcy\\nThe law excludes transactions where the vendor is in external administration or\\ntransactions arising from the administration of a bankrupt estate, a composition or\\nscheme of arrangement, a debt agreement, a personal insolvency agreement, or\\nsame or similar circumstances under a foreign law.\\nVarying the amount to be withheld\\nThe amount to be withheld can be varied by us or at the initiative of a party with an\\ninterest in a transaction, including a creditor. This supports the principle whereby\\nwe must take a creditor’s rights into account.\\nVendors can apply for a variation where the following apply:\\nthey are not entitled to a clearance certificate\\na vendor’s declaration is not appropriate\\n224 of 253\\n12.5% withholding is too high compared to the actual Australian tax liability on\\nthe sale of the asset.\\nReasons for a variation could include instances where:\\nthe foreign resident will not make a capital gain on the transaction (for\\nexample, because they will make a capital loss or a CGT rollover applies)\\nthe foreign resident will otherwise not have an income tax liability (for example,\\nbecause of carried-forward capital losses or tax losses)\\nthere are multiple vendors, only one of whom is a foreign resident\\na creditor of the vendor has a mortgage or other security interest over the\\nproperty and the proceeds of sale available at settlement are insufficient to\\ncover both the amount to be withheld and to discharge the debt the property\\nsecures.\\nForeign residents for tax purposes who held property on 9 May 2017 were able to\\nclaim the CGT main residence exemption where the CGT event (disposal) of the\\nproperty occurred on or before 30 June 2020.\\nExample: Vendor applies for variation\\nForeign resident Victor is selling a commercial property located in Australia\\nwith a cost base of $3 million.\\nVictor does not expect to be able to sell the property for $3 million or more\\n(that is, he expects to make a capital loss on the sale).\\nVictor applies to us for a variation.\\nWe issue a variation notice to Victor under which the amount to be withheld\\nis reduced to nil.\\nThe variation is subject to the condition that the purchase price for the\\nproperty does not exceed $3 million.\\nPaul then agrees to purchase the property from Victor for $2.9 million. Victor\\nprovides a copy of the variation notice to Paul. The variation takes effect\\nand Paul does not withhold any amount.\\n \\nExample: Variation to meet a secured creditor obligation\\nForeign resident Daniel owns a commercial property located in Australia. He\\nowes $2.9 million to a bank, secured by a mortgage over the property.\\nDaniel and the bank are not related parties. Daniel has met all his loan\\nobligations and there is nothing to suggest he will not continue to do this.\\n225 of 253\\nDaniel enters into a contract to sell the property for $3 million. The\\npurchaser knows Daniel is a foreign resident, and that they would normally\\nbe required to withhold $375,000 and pay that amount to us.\\nIf they do so, Daniel won’t have sufficient sale proceeds to discharge the\\nmortgage. Daniel is entitled to apply for a variation. We would work with\\nDaniel and the bank to achieve a sensible outcome.\\n \\nExample: Creditor applying for a variation\\nForeign resident Chris owns a commercial property located in Australia. He\\nowes $3 million to a bank, secured by a mortgage over the property.\\nChris’s business has been performing poorly and he has missed a number\\nof loan repayments. The bank decides to take possession of the property\\nand exercise its power of sale.\\nThe property is sold for $2.9 million net of costs. The proceeds are\\ninsufficient to withhold the 12.5% to be paid to us and to discharge Chris’s\\nmortgage.\\nChris prefers us to be paid rather than the bank, because he would be\\nentitled to a credit for this amount withheld. Therefore, he does not apply for\\na variation (even though one may be available if he made a capital loss).\\nThe bank is entitled to apply for a variation and does so.\\nWe consider the circumstances and conclude that requiring an amount to be\\nwithheld and paid to us would prevent the bank from recovering the debt\\nfrom its secured interest.\\nWe issue a notice to the bank varying the amount to be withheld to nil.\\nThe bank provides a copy of the notice to the purchaser. The purchaser is\\nrelieved of any obligation to withhold and pay an amount to us.\\nHow to apply for a variation\\nTo apply for a variation, the vendor or vendor’s creditor needs to complete the\\nonline Foreign resident capital gains withholding rate variation application form. To\\naccess the form, visit \\nato.gov.au/FRCGW\\n.\\nIf the vendor hasn’t lodged a variation certificate online, conveyancers (who are not\\nlegal practitioners or registered tax agents) cannot complete the form on behalf of\\n226 of 253\\nthe vendor. They can provide either the PDF version of the variation form (or\\nhyperlink) to the vendor for completion. Conveyancers may submit the completed\\nPDF form to us via mail or fax, or enter the data into the online form (retaining a\\ncopy of the vendor-signed PDF form and keeping a printout of data entered into the\\nonline form).\\nTime it takes to obtain a variation notice\\nIn the majority of cases (where we have received all the required information) a\\nvariation notice will be issued within 28 days.\\nVariation notices will be sent by email if an email address is provided in the\\napplication. Otherwise notices will be mailed to the vendor and the applicant using\\nthe addresses provided in the application. The variation notice should be shown to\\nthe purchaser before settlement to ensure the reduced withholding rate applies.\\nCalculating the reduced rate of withholding\\nVendors need to calculate their reduced rate of withholding. This could be a rate\\nbetween nil and 12.49%, for example, if you made no capital gain put in 0%.\\nAny varied rate approved by us will depend on the information provided by the\\nvendor in their application.\\nVariation notices and multiple vendors\\nA variation notice applies to the specified vendor and applicable asset on the notice.\\nIf an asset is acquired from multiple vendors, each vendor will need to supply the\\npurchasers with separate variation notices if a reduced rate of withholding is to\\napply to each vendor.\\nVariation notice validity\\nA variation notice is valid for 12 months from the date of issue for the listed vendor\\nand applicable asset on the notice.\\nVendors must ensure the details on their application are accurate so the variation\\nnotice issues with the correct vendor and applicable asset details.\\nIt is the vendor’s responsibility to provide the purchaser with the variation notice and\\nensure it is valid at the time of settlement.\\nFor the purchaser to rely on the variation notice the:\\nname of the vendor and applicable asset details on the notice must match\\nthose on the certificate of title or other asset ownership documentation\\nsettlement date must be on or before the expiry date on the variation notice.\\nWhen a purchaser receives a valid variation notice from a vendor they can rely on it\\nand not withhold.\\nIf the variation notice does not meet the above-mentioned conditions, the purchaser\\n227 of 253\\nis required to withhold 12.5% of the purchase price.\\nA purchaser can check the validity of a variation notice with us prior to deciding\\nwhether to withhold the 12.5% amount from the purchase price. Phone us on\\n13 28 66\\n (fast key codes \\n4 2\\n) to confirm the validity of the variation notice, by\\nproviding the:\\nnumber from the ‘Our reference’ field at the top of the notice\\nvendor’s name, varied rate and applicable asset details as they appear on the\\nnotice.\\nCalculating the amount to withhold\\nWhere a purchaser has determined they have an obligation to withhold, they must\\nwithhold 12.5% (or a varied rate as per a valid variation certificate) from the ‘first\\nelement of the cost base’ of the asset.\\nThe first element of the cost base is an existing tax concept which is the amount of\\nmoney paid (or required to be paid) or the market value of any property given (or\\nrequired to be given) to acquire the asset.\\nHowever, as purchase price is understood by vendors and purchasers, and in many\\ninstances will be equal to the first element of the cost base, where the transaction is\\nat arms-length, the purchase price may be used in determining how much\\nwithholding is required.\\nWe recognise that some assets subject to this withholding measure may involve the\\npayment of disbursements as part of the contract. Where the purchase price is used\\nas a proxy for market value, the market value is the purchase price before\\nadjustment for any disbursements at settlement (for example, for council rates,\\nwater and sewer charges and strata levies). Therefore, the $750,000 threshold test\\nfor taxable Australian real property is applied to the purchase price before\\nadjustment for disbursements.\\nExample: How much to withhold and pay\\nClaudia is buying a house where the contract price is $3.3 million. She has\\nbeen advised by the vendor’s representative that the vendor is a foreign\\nresident.\\nDepending upon the particulars of the contract, the $3.3 million may be\\ncomprised of the purchase price for the property, plus a number of other\\ncosts associated with the property that Claudia has agreed with the vendor\\nto pay for.\\nIn this case Claudia advises that they are withholding based upon the\\ncontracted purchase price of the property. Therefore the first element of the\\ncost base is assumed to be the same as the purchase price; this means the\\npurchase price is used to determine the amount to be withheld.\\n228 of 253\\nClaudia therefore withholds $412,500 (12.5% of $3.3 million).\\nMultiple purchasers\\nWhere there are multiple purchasers, each purchaser does not look at their\\npercentage interest in isolation to the other purchasers in determining whether they\\nshould withhold. Each purchaser must withhold in proportion to their percentage of\\nthe total purchase price.\\nWhere the asset being disposed of is taxable Australian real property, the market\\nvalue of all purchasers’ interests must be aggregated in examining whether the\\n$750,000 market value threshold has been reached. If the aggregated purchase\\nprice is $750,000 or more, each purchaser must withhold in proportion to their\\npercentage of the total purchase price.\\nExample: Multiple purchasers\\nYou are purchasing a commercial property jointly with another entity. Your\\nshare of the acquisition is 40%, for which you are paying $675,000. This\\nmeans the total property purchase price would be $1.5 million.\\nEven though your purchaser’s interest is below the $750,000 threshold, the\\nproperty as a whole exceeds the $750,000 threshold – so you will need to\\nwithhold $84,375.\\nMultiple vendors\\nIf multiple vendors are disposing of an asset, the total market value of the asset\\ndetermines whether withholding is required by the purchaser.\\nIf the purchaser has not been provided with a clearance certificate, vendor\\ndeclaration or a variation from any of the vendors, the purchaser must withhold\\n12.5% of the purchase price. The amount of withholding will be in proportion to\\neach vendor’s interest in the asset.\\nWhere one (but not all) of the vendors provides a clearance certificate or vendor\\ndeclaration to the purchaser, the withholding obligation still applies as there is still a\\nforeign resident vendor to the transaction. The amount of withholding is still on the\\nentire first element of the cost base of the asset, not just the portion that is\\nattributable to the relevant foreign resident vendor’s interest in the asset.\\nWe recognise that in this situation, any vendors that are subject to the withholding\\nwould apply for a variation to ensure that the withholding amount better reflected\\nthe foreign resident vendor’s tax liability. They would receive a reduction in the\\nwithholding rate accordingly.\\n229 of 253\\nTo reduce the need for vendors to apply for variations in these situations, our\\napproach is that where there are multiple vendors, the purchaser may withhold in\\naccordance with each vendor’s proportional interest in the purchase price, subject\\nto any clearance certificate, vendor declaration or vendor variation being provided\\nprior to settlement.\\nThe following situations are from the perspective of a purchaser who is deciding\\nwhat to do in terms of withholding. In all instances it is assumed the purchase price\\nis $750,000 or more.\\nExample: Joint owners but only one vendor is an Australian resident\\nThe purchaser has to withhold as a vendor is deemed to be a foreign\\nresident. The purchaser would need to see a clearance certificate from the\\nAustralian resident vendor. If the clearance certificate is not provided by\\nsettlement then the purchaser has to withhold an amount form both vendors.\\nHowever, if a clearance certificate is provided before settlement by the\\nAustralian resident, the purchaser only has to withhold from the foreign\\nresident vendor. The withholding would normally be on the full purchase\\nprice of the property – but we are allowing the withholding amount to be\\ncalculated on the foreign resident’s interest in the purchase price only.\\n \\nExample: Foreign resident vendor provides a variation\\nThe circumstances are identical but now the foreign resident vendor\\nprovides the purchaser with a variation notice and the Australian vendor\\nprovides a clearance certificate. The purchaser does not have to withhold\\nan amount from the Australian resident. The purchaser has to withhold from\\nthe foreign vendor, but the rate of withholding is not 12.5% but the\\nwithholding rate is as specified on the variation notice issued by us to the\\nforeign resident vendor.\\n \\nExample: Multiple foreign resident vendors\\nAs the property is being sold by foreign residents the purchaser knows they\\nmust withhold. The purchaser has not received a clearance certificate, and\\ntherefore must assume all the vendors are foreign residents.\\n230 of 253\\nAbsent any variation notices, the purchaser must withhold from each foreign\\nresident vendor an amount based on their proportionate interest in the\\nproperty – that is, 12.5% of their share of the purchase price. The sum of\\nthe withholding amounts should equal 12.5% of the full purchase price.\\nHowever, if some or all of the foreign resident vendors provide the\\npurchaser with a variation notice, the purchaser must apply the specified\\nwithholding rate to that vendor’s share of the purchase price. For example, it\\nmay be that the purchaser has to withhold 8% from one vendor, and 3%\\nfrom another vendor.\\nThe purchaser will need to ensure that the correct amount is withheld from\\neach vendor.\\nMultiple properties in one transaction\\nA vendor may be disposing of multiple properties in one transaction, the combined\\nvalue of which exceeds $750,000. The withholding is based on the market value of\\na property being disposed of – not a combination of all the properties being\\ndisposed of.\\nThe withholding is not an additional payment on top of the agreed purchaser\\nprice\\nThe obligation for the purchaser to withhold an amount and pay it to us is not an\\nadditional payment on top of the agreed purchase price. The withholding amount is\\ntaken from the amount of purchase price that the purchaser has agreed to pay the\\nvendor.\\nA purchaser that withholds in accordance with their Australian income tax\\nobligations is protected by sub-section 16-20(2) of Schedule 1 of the \\nTaxation\\nAdministration Act 1953\\n. This discharges the purchaser from their liability to pay\\nthis part of the total purchase price directly to the vendor.\\nWhen withholding is required\\nWithholding is not required from deposits paid on signing of the contract. No\\npayment is required when the purchaser signs the contract and pays the deposit.\\nThe purchaser is not required to pay the Commissioner until the day the purchaser\\nbecomes the owner of the asset, that is, on settlement.\\nIf payments are to be made in multiple instalments across the contract period,\\nwithholding should only occur when the final payment is made at settlement. The\\nwithholding amount is still calculated using the full purchase price of the asset.\\nIf the contract doesn’t settle\\nIf for some reason the contract is not completed (settled), there is no obligation on\\nthe purchaser to withhold. This is because the purchaser has not become the\\n231 of 253\\nowner of the asset, and therefore there is no obligation to pay an amount to us.\\nIf the purchaser fails to withhold\\nIf the purchaser fails to withhold when they should, a penalty may be imposed by\\nthe Commissioner which is equal to the amount that was required to be withheld\\nand paid. General interest charges will also be applied.\\nGoods and services tax\\nMarket value\\nThe $750,000 threshold for real property is based upon the ‘market value’ of that\\nproperty. Market value can be affected by the income tax law which provides that\\nthe market value of an asset at a particular time (in this case just after the\\ntransaction) is reduced by the amount of any input tax credit the purchaser is\\nentitled to, assuming that both:\\nthe asset had been acquired at the relevant time\\nthe acquisition had been solely for a creditable purpose.\\nConsequently, on the basis that the parties are acting at arm’s length:\\nWhere a purchaser is not registered for goods and services tax (GST), or the\\nsupply of the asset is not a taxable supply, or the purchaser is not able to claim\\nan input tax credit on the purchase, the GST-inclusive purchase price payable\\nby the purchaser may be used as a proxy for the market value of the asset.\\nWhere the purchaser is registered for GST and the transaction is a taxable\\nsupply, and the purchaser is able to claim an input tax credit on the purchase,\\nthe GST-inclusive purchase price less the input tax credit may be used as a\\nproxy for the market value of the asset.\\nThe sale of existing residential premises (but not commercial residential premises or\\nnew residential premises) is input taxed and therefore not a taxable supply. Where\\nthe asset is shares (for example company title interests), the supply of shares is\\ninput taxed and therefore not a taxable supply.\\nIf the margin scheme is used, a purchaser cannot claim input tax credits on that\\nacquisition, even if they are registered for GST and intend to use the purchased\\nproperty for a creditable purpose. In these instances, a GST-registered purchaser\\nshould calculate the 12.5% withholding by using the GST-inclusive price.\\nExample: Determining market value when GST is involved\\nEdwina is a successful entrepreneur in the manufacturing industry. She\\nacquires a vacant Sydney commercial property for $5.3 million to expand her\\nbusiness. She knows the vendor is a foreign resident, because she had not\\nreceived a clearance certificate at settlement.\\nWhat is the market value for determining the withholding amount?\\n232 of 253\\nEdwina is registered for GST as her manufacturing business generates\\nturnover that requires this.\\nGST has been included in the contract to buy the commercial property, and\\nequals 1/11th of the total purchase price of $5.3 million that Edwina paid.\\nShe holds a valid tax invoice for the purchase.\\nThe commercial property is to be used for expanding Edwina’s\\nmanufacturing business, so it will be used for a creditable purpose. That is,\\nused by Edwina in her enterprise of making taxable supplies of\\nmanufactured goods.\\nConsequently, the market value upon which Edwina will withhold is\\n$5.3 million minus the GST that has formed part of the purchase price.\\nFor a fully taxable supply, GST = 1/11th of the purchase price, so the\\nmarket value will equal 10/11ths of $5.3 million – or approximately\\n$4.82 million.\\nGST and the first element of the cost base\\nThe 12.5% withholding rate is to be applied against the ‘first element of the cost\\nbase’ of the asset that the purchaser is acquiring.\\nHowever, as purchase price is understood by vendors and purchasers, and in many\\ninstances will be equal to the first element of the cost base, where the transaction is\\nat arm’s length the purchase price may be used to determine how much to withhold.\\nThe actual purchase price may depend upon whether or not a purchaser is\\nregistered (or is required to be registered) for \\nGST\\n. The following should be taken\\ninto account:\\nWhere the purchaser is registered for GST and the transaction is a taxable\\nsupply, and the purchaser is able to claim an input tax credit on the purchase,\\nthe first element of the cost base can be reduced by the amount of any GST\\nnet input tax credits (that is, GST the purchaser can claim back) included in the\\ncost.\\nWhere a purchaser is not registered for GST or the supply of the asset is not a\\ntaxable supply, or the purchaser is not able to claim an input tax credit on the\\npurchase, the purchaser does not make any adjustment; the GST is included\\nin the first element of the cost base.\\nThe sale of existing residential premises (but not commercial residential premises or\\nnew residential premises) is input taxed and therefore not a taxable supply. Where\\nthe asset is shares (for example, company title interests), the supply of shares is\\ninput taxed and therefore not a taxable supply.\\nIf the margin scheme is used, you cannot claim input tax credits on that\\nacquisition, even if you are registered for GST and intend to use the\\n233 of 253\\npurchased property for a creditable purpose. GST-registered purchasers\\nshould calculate the 12.5% withholding by using the GST-inclusive price in the\\nfirst element of the cost base.\\nExample: Determining the cost base when GST is involved\\nXavier is registered for GST and is acquiring a retail building that is already\\ntenanted. The vendor did not agree in writing to supply the building as a\\nGST-free going concern, so the supply is fully taxable. The GST- inclusive\\nprice as per the contract is $3.7 million.\\nXavier knows from paying for financial advice from a reputable accounting\\nfirm that he will be entitled to claim back input tax credits from this\\ntransaction as long as he holds a valid tax invoice for the purchase.\\nAt settlement no clearance certificate has been provided by the vendor.\\nXavier knows he has to withhold but is concerned as to what amount it\\nshould be based on, as the financial advice he received is quiet on this\\nmatter.\\nXavier has confirmation he can claim input tax credits reflecting the GST he\\nhas paid as part of the contract to acquire the building.\\nGiven the vendor has failed to present a clearance certificate, Xavier knows\\nhe must potentially withhold, depending upon what the ‘first element of the\\ncost base’ of the retail building is.\\nThere is nothing to suggest this transaction is not an arm’s length\\narrangement, so the purchase price can be used as a proxy for the ‘first\\nelement of the cost base’.\\nXavier is registered for GST and at settlement obtained a valid tax invoice\\nfor the transaction showing the purchase price and the GST amount\\nincluded in that price.\\nTo work out the market value, Xavier deducts the GST he is entitled to claim\\nback as an input tax credit. The tax invoice indicates the input tax credits\\ntotal $336,363 (that is, 1/11th of $3.7 million).\\nConsequently, the 12.5% withholding is to be applied to $3.7 million less\\n$336,363 = $3,363,637.\\nPaying the ATO\\nThe purchaser must pay the required amount to us on or before the day they\\nbecome the owner of the property.\\n234 of 253\\nNo withholding and payment obligation arises if the contract falls through and\\nchange in ownership does not occur.\\nIn recognition of the practicalities of making payment at settlement, we will allow a\\nshort period after settlement to receive payment before imposing general interest\\ncharges and initiating recovery action.\\nExample: When to pay\\nBen acquired a residential property for $3 million.

Therefore, the\\nacquisition of a lease from a foreign resident vendor with a market value of\\n$750,000 or more would be subject to the 12.5% withholding, unless the lessor\\nprovided the lessee with a clearance certificate.\\n236 of 253\\nHowever, the withholding obligation only arises with respect to any lease premium\\npaid by the lessee to acquire the lease, as they form part of the first element of the\\ncost base of the lease.\\nA lease that does not include the payment of a premium will not result in a\\nwithholding liability.\\nRent payable under the term of the lease does not form part of the first element of\\nthe cost base.\\nExample: Granting a lease\\nForeign resident Richard owns a commercial property that he leases to\\nLeigh. As a foreign resident, Richard is not entitled to a clearance certificate.\\nUnder the terms of the lease, Leigh agrees to pay Richard $3 million as a\\npremium for granting the lease and to pay periodic rent of $4,000 a month.\\nThe first element of the cost base of Leigh’s lease asset is $3 million. Leigh\\nmust withhold and pay 12.5% of this amount ($375,000) to us.\\nThe rent payable under the lease does not form part of the first element of\\ncost base.\\nWithholding tax credits and refunds\\nWithholding tax credits\\nA foreign resident vendor must lodge a tax return at the end of the financial year,\\ndeclaring their Australian assessable income and including any capital gain from the\\ndisposal of their asset. The vendor will claim a credit for any withholding amount\\npaid to us by the purchaser in their tax return.\\nThe availability of a credit to a foreign resident is contingent on the purchaser\\npaying the amount to us. A credit does not arise merely because an amount has\\nbeen withheld.\\nA foreign resident vendor disposing of Australian property to which these\\nwithholding tax rules apply should apply for a tax file number (TFN) before they\\nlodge an Australian tax return. This will ensure they can claim a credit for the\\namount withheld and paid to us by the purchaser.\\nIn certain circumstances, an early income tax return may be submitted. If a foreign\\nresident vendor is not eligible to submit an early income tax return, they must wait\\nuntil the end of the financial year to do so. However they will receive a tax credit for\\nthe withholding paid by the purchaser.\\nRefunds\\n237 of 253\\nWe may refund an amount incorrectly withheld and paid by the purchaser. The\\nvendor cannot claim a refund from the purchaser.\\nPenalties for non-compliance\\nUnder this measure, the purchaser must both withhold and pay that withholding to\\nus, even if they use representatives to assist them in the process.\\nAdministrative penalties apply for failure to adhere to the foreign resident capital\\ngains withholding legislation.\\nThe offence provision for failing to withhold also applies.\\nA general interest charge is imposed for amounts not paid to us by the required\\ndate.\\nIt is an offence to falsely claim a credit.\\nThe law imposes penalties of up to 120 penalty units for declarations or purported\\ndeclarations that are false or misleading.\\nGlossary\\nIndirect Australian real property interest\\nWhere two tests are satisfied: the non-portfolio interest test, and the principal asset\\ntest. Indirect Australian real property interest includes shares in a company or units\\nin a trust.\\nKnowledge condition\\nWhere the purchaser knows, or has reason to believe, that the vendor is a relevant\\nforeign resident.\\nNon-final withholding tax\\nA non-final withholding tax is collected as an estimate of the recipient’s final income\\ntax liability. The recipient is still required to lodge an income tax return and pay any\\noutstanding debit. They claim a credit for the amount of tax withheld in the income\\ntax return at this time.\\nNon-portfolio interest test\\nAn interest held by an entity (the holding entity) in another entity (the test entity) is a\\nnon-portfolio interest if the sum of the membership interests held by the holding\\nentity (and their associates) in the test entity is 10% or more.\\nThe test is satisfied if the membership interest is a non-portfolio interest at the time\\nof the transaction, or through a 12-month period in the last 24 months leading up to\\nthe transaction.\\n238 of 253\\nRelevant asset (also referred to ‘assets that the law applies to’ in this guide)\\nThis is taxable Australian real property, an indirect Australian real property interest,\\nor an option or right to acquire such property or such an interest.\\nRelevant foreign resident vendors (also referred to as ‘vendors that the law\\napplies to’ in this guide)\\nThe vendor is a relevant foreign resident if one or more of these scenarios apply:\\nThe purchaser knows the vendor is a foreign resident.\\nThe purchaser reasonably believes the vendor is a foreign resident.\\nThe purchaser does not reasonably believe the vendor is an Australian\\nresident, and either\\nthe vendor has an address outside Australia (according to any record that\\nis in the purchaser’s possession, or is kept or maintained on their behalf,\\nabout the transaction)\\nthe vendor authorises provision of a related financial benefit to a place\\noutside Australia (whether to the vendor or to anyone else).\\n \\nThe vendor has a connection outside Australia of a kind specified in the\\nregulations.\\nPrincipal asset test\\nThis is used to determine if an entity’s underlying value is principally derived from\\nAustralian real property.\\nA membership interest in an entity passes the principal asset test if the sum of the\\nmarket values of the entity’s assets that are taxable Australian real property\\nexceeds the sum of the market values of the assets that are not.\\nTaxable Australian real property\\nThis is real property situated in Australia (including a lease of land situated in\\nAustralia), or a mining, quarrying or prospecting right (to the extent that the right is\\nnot real property), if the minerals, petroleum or quarry materials are situated in\\nAustralia.\\nMore information\\nFor more information and forms, visit \\nato.gov.au/FRCGW\\n.\\nLegislation and supporting materials\\nTreasury Laws Amendment (Foreign Resident Capital Gains Withholding\\nPayments) Act 2017 (Act No. 57 of 2017)\\n – received royal assent on 22 June\\n2017\\nTax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2015 Measures No. 6) Act 2016\\n –\\nreceived royal assent on 25 February 2016\\nLaw companion rulings\\n239 of 253\\nThe following rulings describe how we apply the law:\\nForeign resident capital gains withholding regime: the Commissioner's variation\\npower\\nForeign resident capital gains withholding regime: amount payable to the\\nCommissioner\\nForeign resident capital gains withholding regime: options\\nRelationship breakdown and capital gains tax\\nhttps://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Capital-gains-tax/Relationship-breakdown-\\nand-capital-gains-tax/\\nLast modified: 01 Jul 2022\\nQC 66063\\nFind out if you can defer, or 'roll over', CGT on assets that transfer to you in a\\ndivorce.\\nWhen the relationship breakdown rollover applies\\nCheck that you have a court order or formal agreement that qualifies for the\\nrelationship breakdown CGT rollover.\\nCalculating CGT on a rollover asset\\nFind out when CGT applies to an asset after a relationship breakdown, and how to\\nwork out the asset's cost.\\nMain residence exemption in relationship breakdown\\nIf a property was the home of you or your spouse, check if it is exempt from CGT.\\nWhen the relationship breakdown rollover\\napplies\\nhttps://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Capital-gains-tax/Relationship-breakdown-\\nand-capital-gains-tax/When-the-relationship-breakdown-rollover-applies/\\nLast modified: 01 Jul 2022\\nQC 66064\\nCheck that you have a court order or formal agreement that qualifies for the\\nrelationship breakdown CGT rollover.\\n240 of 253\\nOn this page\\nRelationship breakdown rollover\\nQualifying agreements\\nPrivate or informal agreements\\nCGT events the rollover applies to\\nTiming of the CGT event\\nRelationship breakdown rollover\\nWhen 2 people separate or divorce, assets transferred between them usually\\nqualify for the relationship breakdown rollover.\\nThis means capital gains tax (CGT), which normally applies when ownership of an\\nasset changes, is deferred.
